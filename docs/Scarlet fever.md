# Scarlet fever 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: 
According to the provided data, there is a noticeable seasonal pattern in the occurrence of Scarlet fever cases in mainland China. The number of cases is consistently highest from November to March, with a peak in December and January. On the other hand, the number of cases is generally lower from April to October, with the fewest cases occurring in the summer months of June, July, and August.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for Scarlet fever cases in mainland China is during the winter months, specifically in December and January when the number of cases reaches its highest point. Conversely, the trough period, or the period with the lowest number of cases, is observed in the summer months of June, July, and August, consistently displaying the lowest number of cases compared to the rest of the year.

Overall Trends: 
The number of Scarlet fever cases in mainland China has shown an increasing trend from 2010 to 2023. While there are yearly fluctuations in the number of cases, with some years experiencing higher peaks than others, there is a general upward trend over time.

Discussion: 
The observed seasonal patterns in the data indicate that Scarlet fever in mainland China follows a typical seasonal pattern, with higher transmission during the winter months and lower transmission during the summer months. This pattern aligns with the known characteristics of Scarlet fever, which typically exhibits higher prevalence in colder weather.

The analysis of peak and trough periods reveals that the highest number of cases occurs in the winter months, particularly in December and January, while the lowest number of cases occurs in the summer months of June, July, and August. This information can be valuable for public health officials in planning and implementing interventions to control the spread of Scarlet fever, such as increasing awareness and implementing preventive measures during peak months.

The overall increasing trend in the number of Scarlet fever cases over the years suggests that this disease remains a significant public health concern in mainland China. Multiple factors, including changes in population density, healthcare access, and surveillance systems, may influence this trend. Further analysis and investigation are necessary to comprehend the underlying factors contributing to the increasing trend and develop effective strategies for prevention and control.

It is important to note that the analysis is based on the provided data, and additional information such as population size, demographic characteristics, and other relevant factors would further enhance the understanding of Scarlet fever trends in mainland China.
## Introduction

Scarlet fever is an infectious disease caused by group A Streptococcus bacteria, the same organism responsible for strep throat. Characterized by a bright red rash that feels like sandpaper, it typically affects children aged 5 to 15. Key symptoms include a high fever, sore throat, and bright red tongue (often described as "strawberry tongue"), along with the rash developing within one to two days of infection. While once considered a serious childhood illness, it's now treatable with antibiotics and has become less common and less severe with improved medical care.

## Highlights

- A notable decline is seen in the number of Scarlet fever cases in 2020, likely due to public health measures for COVID-19. <br/>
- After 2020, there is a gradual return to pre-2020 case levels, with fluctuations within the expected seasonal pattern, peaking around May to July. <br/>
- No deaths have been reported from Scarlet fever in October 2023, which suggests effective clinical management and infection control. <br/>
- The peak in 2019 before the drop in 2020 suggests a pre-pandemic escalation, after which incidence rates are stabilizing without reaching the same heights. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Scarlet fever cases in mainland China exhibit a pronounced seasonality, with a recurrent upsurge from May to July, aligning with the warmer and more humid climate that may favor the transmission of Streptococcus pyogenes. A decadal trend reveals an increase from 2010 to 2019, peaking annually with over 10,000 cases by mid-decade. However, a stark decrease is observed starting 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic onset, potentially due to public health interventions like social distancing and heightened hygiene practices. By 2023, there seems to be a gradual resurgence of cases, yet numbers have not rebounded to the pre-pandemic level.

### Deaths Analysis

Scarlet fever fatalities in mainland China are rare, with only four recorded deaths from 2010 to 2023, amidst tens of thousands of cases, indicating a low case-fatality rate. The isolated deaths in 2011, 2012, 2015, and 2020 illustrate the usual effective management and treatment of the infection with antibiotics. The lack of fatalities despite the high incidence rate may also reflect improved healthcare access, public awareness, and possibly under-reporting. Continuous monitoring is essential, particularly with the slight increase in cases post-2020.
