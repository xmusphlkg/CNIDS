# Schistosomiasis 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns:
Based on the data provided, a seasonal pattern in the number of Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China is evident. The incidence of cases is higher during the summer months (June, July, and August) and lower during the winter months (December, January, and February). This observation suggests a potential association between Schistosomiasis transmission and seasonal factors, such as temperature and rainfall.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China occurs during the summer months, particularly in July and August. During these months, the number of cases reaches its highest point, indicating a peak in transmission. Conversely, the trough period for Schistosomiasis cases occurs during the winter months, with the fewest number of cases reported in December and January.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there is a decreasing trend in the number of Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China before October 2023. Between 2010 and 2015, there was a gradual increase in the number of cases, with a significant spike in 2015. However, since 2015, there has been a steady decline in the number of cases, with occasional fluctuations. This observation suggests the effectiveness of control measures and interventions implemented in recent years in reducing the burden of Schistosomiasis in mainland China.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal patterns in the data indicate that Schistosomiasis transmission in mainland China is influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and rainfall. The peak transmission during the summer months may be attributed to favorable conditions for the survival and reproduction of the Schistosoma parasite, as well as increased human activities in water bodies. The decline in cases after 2015 suggests that control measures, including mass drug administration, snail control, and health education campaigns, have been successful in reducing the transmission of Schistosomiasis.

It is important to note that the provided data only encompasses cases and deaths up until October 2023. Further analysis and monitoring of Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China beyond this period would be necessary to assess long-term trends and the effectiveness of control measures. Additionally, considering other factors, such as changes in water resource management, socioeconomic factors, and population movements, may provide valuable insights into the transmission dynamics of Schistosomiasis.
## Introduction

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. The urinary tract or intestines may be infected by these worms. Infections occur through contact with contaminated water in which schistosome snails that carry the parasites are living. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. Schistosomiasis is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions, affecting millions of people worldwide.

## Highlights

- A significant peak in schistosomiasis cases occurred in 2015, with the highest monthly case count reaching 10,481 in November. This suggests a major outbreak or change in surveillance/reporting. <br/>
- After 2015, there has been a dramatic decrease in cases, with only a few spikes observed; e.g., in September and October of 2017 with over 1,000 cases each month. <br/>
- Since 2018, cases have consistently remained low, with a clear downtrend reaching single digits in a majority of the months, which could indicate successful disease control and prevention measures. <br/>
- As of October 2023, schistosomiasis cases in mainland China are extremely low, with only 2 cases and no deaths, reflecting an effective containment and possibly nearing elimination. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Initial data from 2010 to mid-2011 indicates low Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China, generally under 700 cases per month with a seasonal peak in summer. However, starting in 2015, a significant surge occurred with the number of cases reaching into the thousands, peaking in November with over 10,000 cases. This unusual spike warrants an investigation into potential outbreaks or changes in reporting standards. After this peak, cases dramatically declined to double digits by 2017, remaining low thereafter. 2022 and 2023 exhibit consistent low-level transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
The fatality record associated with Schistosomiasis from 2010 to 2023 in mainland China reveals a very low death toll, with several years marking zero deaths. Notably, the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 experienced isolated fatalities despite the high number of cases in certain months, perhaps due to improved medical interventions and control measures. The single death in February 2020 amidst low case numbers is an anomaly and might be indicative of an underlying issue such as comorbidities or less timely access to healthcare. Overall, mortality is rare, suggesting effective management of the disease when it does occur.
