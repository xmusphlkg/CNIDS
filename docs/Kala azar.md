# Kala azar

Version: November 2023

## Introduction

Kala azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is a severe parasitic disease caused by the Leishmania donovani complex, transmitted through the bite of certain types of sandflies. Approximately 50,000 to 90,000 new cases occur worldwide yearly. If left untreated, the fatality rate can be as high as 100% within two years. It prominently occurs in tropical and subtropical regions, with notable prevalence in India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, and Brazil. Symptoms often include fever, weight loss, fatigue, anemia, and enlargement of the spleen and liver.

## Highlights

1. General downward trend in Kala azar cases: Over the past decade, Chinese mainland has experienced a general decrease in case numbers, reflecting an improvement in disease control. <br/>
2. Seasonality evident: An increased number of cases are identified from October to January, suggesting a seasonal trend. <br/>
3. Low mortality rate: Despite the annual case fluctuations, the fatality rate remains extremely low, indicating effective case management and treatment strategies. <br/>
4. Higher number of deaths in 2023: Compared to recent years, 2023 has seen increased deaths despite fewer cases, a concern for the healthcare sector.

Between 2010 and 2023, Kala azar cases in Chinese mainland showed a fluctuating pattern with no clear trend of consistent increase or decrease. Peaks were observed in late 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, and a slight increase in 2023. The highest number of reported cases was in November 2015, with 123 new diagnoses. Notably, there were dips (lower number of reported cases) during the 2011-2013 period and a gradual peak reduction in 2015, stabilized afterward around 20-30 cases monthly.

The reported data suggests a low mortality rate for Kala azar within the observed timeframe. Over the 13 years, only nine deaths were reported, occurring sporadically rather than showing a pattern. In the entire timeline, no single month recorded more than one death, highlighting the non-lethal nature of Kala azar when appropriately treated. There was, however, a slight increase in death occurrences towards 2023 which might need to be investigated further for possible causative factors.
