# Rubella 

Version: January 2024 

## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German measles, is a contagious viral infection notable for its distinctive red rash. It's generally mild in children and young adults but can have serious consequences if contracted by pregnant women, potentially causing miscarriage or congenital rubella syndrome, leading to severe birth defects. The virus is transmitted via airborne droplets from the respiratory secretions of infected individuals. Vaccination has made rubella rare in many countries, emphasizing its importance in preventing the spread of the virus and protecting vulnerable populations, especially pregnant women.

## Highlights

- **Significant decrease in cases**: The data shows a notable decline in the number of Rubella cases in Chinese mainland, dropping from thousands in peak years (2014-2019) to below 100 cases by January 2024. <br/>
- **Peak in 2019**: The highest number of reported cases occurred in May 2019, with 9095 cases, indicating a significant outbreak during that period. <br/>
- **Low mortality**: Despite the fluctuations in case numbers, Rubella deaths remained extremely rare, with only a few reported deaths over the entire period. <br/>
- **Trend towards control**: The consistent decrease in cases, especially from 2020 onwards, suggests effective control measures and possibly higher immunization coverage.

The data indicates a significant fluctuation in rubella cases across the years in the Chinese mainland, with a notable peak in 2019, specifically in May with 9095 cases. This spike represents the highest recorded within the provided timeframe. Following this peak, there was a dramatic decline in cases, particularly evident from 2020 onwards, reaching lower levels than those seen at the start of the dataset in 2014. This trend suggests effective interventions were likely implemented, leading to a substantial reduction in rubella transmission.

Rubella-associated deaths in the dataset are extremely rare, with only two reported deaths over the entire period: one in March 2015 and another in June 2019. The scarcity of deaths highlights the generally low fatality rate of rubella, especially in contexts with access to healthcare and vaccination. However, the presence of any deaths underscores the potential severity of rubella, particularly among specific vulnerable populations, and underscores the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent all rubella-related complications.
