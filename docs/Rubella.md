# Rubella 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German measles, is a contagious viral infection best known by its distinctive red rash. It's caused by the Rubella virus and primarily spread through droplets from an infected person's sneeze or cough. While generally mild in children, Rubella can cause serious complications for pregnant women, including miscarriage or severe birth defects in the unborn baby. Effective prevention is possible through the MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. Despite vaccination efforts, Rubella remains a risk in many parts of the world.
## Highlights

- A significant peak in Rubella cases was observed in mid-2019 with a notable decline subsequently, indicating a potential outbreak control success. <br/>
- Overall, after the peak in 2019, case numbers have demonstrated a downward trend, particularly in 2020 and onwards, with decreased fluctuations in case counts. <br/>
- Deaths are exceedingly rare throughout the recorded period, reinforcing Rubella's typically mild nature, and indicating effective case management. <br/>
- The current disease situation as of November 2023 shows consistently low case numbers, suggesting stable transmission levels and ongoing control measures' effectiveness.

From November 2013 to November 2023, mainland China reported a total of 63608 cases of Rubella with cases peaking in May 2019 with 9095 cases. A significant spike occurred in 2019, with peaks in April and May, followed by a stark decrease in 2020. Beyond this spike, case numbers followed a cyclical pattern with increased reports in the spring months. The incidence declined noticeably in 2020 and remained low through 2023, suggesting effective control measures or reporting changes. Throughout the recorded timeframe, there were two anomalies with one death reported in March 2015 and March 2022, indicating an otherwise non-fatal disease progression in reported cases.

Over the ten-year period, Rubella in Chinese mainland displayed a mortality profile with a total of only two deaths despite fluctuating case numbers. A single death was reported in March 2015 and another in March 2022, suggesting an exceedingly low case-fatality rate. The consistent report of zero deaths in other periods reinforces the generally benign nature of Rubella outcomes, assuming comprehensive reporting. The rarity of deaths may reflect effective case management and the availability of supportive care, with the caveat that underreporting cannot be completely ruled out without further validation of the surveillance data.
