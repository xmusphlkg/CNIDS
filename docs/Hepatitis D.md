# Hepatitis D 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as delta hepatitis, is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which is unique among the hepatitis viruses as it requires the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to replicate. This means that only individuals already infected with HBV can contract hepatitis D. It can occur either as a coinfection with HBV or as a superinfection in individuals with chronic hepatitis B. Hepatitis D is transmitted through contact with infected blood, needles, and sexual contact, often leading to more severe liver disease than HBV alone.

## Highlights

- Overall, there is a declining trend in reported cases of Hepatitis D in mainland China from 60 cases in January 2016 to 15 cases in September 2023. <br/>
- Despite fluctuations, there is no recorded increase in mortality; all reported cases have zero associated deaths throughout the data period. <br/>
- A notable reduction in cases occurred in the year 2020, which suggests either improved disease management or underreporting, possibly due to overlapping healthcare priorities such as the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/>
- Since 2020, case numbers have remained relatively low and stable, indicating possible effectiveness of public health interventions or sustained low endemicity in the region. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Hepatitis D in mainland China from January 2016 to September 2023 indicate a general downward trend, with an initial average of 45 cases per month in 2016 gradually decreasing to an average of around 20 cases per month by 2023. There are minor fluctuations observed, such as peaks in May 2017 and September 2017, along with a notable dip starting from January 2020, which could be associated with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on surveillance and reporting systems. However, the data reveals no single month with an alarming spike, suggesting controlled transmission of the virus over these years.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the reported period, there is a consistently low mortality rate associated with Hepatitis D cases, with no deaths recorded in any month from January 2016 to September 2023. This persistent absence of fatalities could be indicative of either effective clinical management and treatment protocols for Hepatitis D cases in China, the low pathogenicity of the prevalent Hepatitis D virus strains, or the underreporting of associated deaths. The zero mortality trend in the data requires further investigation to confirm the underlying reasons and to ensure the robustness and completeness of the reporting system.
