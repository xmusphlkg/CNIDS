> **CNIDS: Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project**
> CNIDS is a project aimed at monitoring notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland. The project utilizes automated technology and data analysis methods to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities for infectious diseases, enabling timely measures to be taken to address potential public health risks.
> The primary objective of the CNIDS project is to establish an efficient infectious disease Surveillance system that enables real-time surveillance of legally notifiable infectious diseases and internet news. It provides decision-makers with timely information and recommendations to facilitate appropriate measures for disease control and prevention.

# Introduction

Given the fictional data constraints and focusing on an exploration of notifiable diseases in Chinese mainland for March 2024, an epidemiological report was crafted to understand the prevalence, death rates, public concerns, and to issue recommendations. This analysis did not include COVID-19, in alignment with the National Bureau of Disease Control and Prevention's directives. Monkeypox was included in Class B infectious disease management starting September 20, 2023. The report also noted that infectious diarrhea figures excluded cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever data.

## Overview

During March 2024, the Chinese mainland witnessed varied incidences of notifiable infectious diseases. Among them, hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), and influenza stood out due to their high case numbers. HIV/AIDS reported 6,391 new cases with 1,771 deaths, indicative of the ongoing challenges in managing chronic infectious diseases effectively. On the other hand, HFMD, with 339,521 reported cases, albeit with a significantly lower mortality rate (4 deaths), highlighted the extensive spread of minor yet highly infectious diseases among the population.

Influenza outbreaks seemed remarkably high with a reported 1,199,771 cases and 16 deaths, demonstrating the vast scale of respiratory infections. Despite the lower mortality rate, the sheer volume of influenza cases underscores the significant burden on the healthcare system, especially during the seasonal peaks. This pattern of disease spread and impact underscores the continuous threat posed by both chronic and acute infectious diseases in the densely populated regions of Chinese mainland.

## Concerns

The high incidence of HFMD and the significant number of HIV/AIDS deaths were particularly concerning. HFMD's widespread nature suggests a persistent susceptibility among children, highlighting the need for enhanced public health measures in schools and daycare centers. In contrast, the number of deaths due to HIV/AIDS, despite being a known entity with available treatment options, marks a critical area for intervention, suggesting issues with treatment access, adherence, or possibly the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains.

Public concern, however, might be significantly swayed by the massive outbreak of influenza, given its sudden and vast impact on a broader demographic. This concern is not solely due to the disease's reach but also due to its potential strain on healthcare resources, affecting the overall management of other diseases. Additionally, the novel inclusion of Monkeypox into the management of Class B infectious diseases raises new public health concerns, requiring vigilance and public education to prevent outbreaks.

## Recommendations

To address these concerns, public health authorities should enhance vaccination drives, specifically targeting at-risk populations for diseases like HIV/AIDS and influenza. For HIV/AIDS, increasing accessibility to antiretroviral therapy and reinforcing education on prevention and treatment adherence are imperative. Meanwhile, annual flu vaccines should be strongly recommended, with campaigns tailored to increase coverage before peak influenza seasons.

For HFMD, emphasis on hygiene practices in schools and public awareness campaigns can play a pivotal role in mitigation. Public health messaging should also adapt to address emerging diseases such as Monkeypox, providing clear guidance on symptoms, transmission, and when to seek medical care.

Cross-sectoral approaches involving education, community leaders, and healthcare systems will be critical. Implementing disease surveillance systems to monitor and respond to outbreaks promptly, alongside international cooperation for information exchange and resource mobilization, will strengthen the overall disease control mechanisms. Public health communication should focus on demystifying diseases, particularly newly managed or emerging ones, to combat stigma and promote proactive healthcare seeking behaviors.

In conclusion, the multifaceted nature of infectious disease management in Chinese mainland calls for an inclusive, proactive, and adaptive public health strategy to protect the populace effectively.
