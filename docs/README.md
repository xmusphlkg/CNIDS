> **CNIDS: Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project**
> CNIDS is a project aimed at monitoring notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland. The project utilizes automated technology and data analysis methods to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities for infectious diseases, enabling timely measures to be taken to address potential public health risks.
> The primary objective of the CNIDS project is to establish an efficient infectious disease Surveillance system that enables real-time surveillance of legally notifiable infectious diseases and internet news. It provides decision-makers with timely information and recommendations to facilitate appropriate measures for disease control and prevention.

# Introduction

## Overview

As we review the reported cases and corresponding deaths from various diseases across Chinese mainland in November 2023, we observe a significant emphasis on respiratory and vector-borne diseases, attributable to the seasonal patterns and other contributing factors. The data showcases a considerable number of cases across a wide array of diseases, with notable figures in diseases such as Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (153,086 cases), and Infectious Diarrhea (108,329 cases). However, it is worth mentioning the notably high case count for Hepatitis, with Hepatitis B leading (96,336 cases), followed by Hepatitis C (20,245 cases), Hepatitis A (1,367 cases), and lesser counts for Hepatitis E and Hepatitis D. The mortality data reflects a concerning number of deaths associated with Tuberculosis (214 deaths), highlighting it as a significant cause of disease burden. Additionally, certain infectious diseases like Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), despite having a lower number of monthly cases (7,897), show a substantial number of all-cause deaths (2,444) in cumulative reported AIDS patients, suggesting the chronic impact of this condition.

## Concerns

Diseases with high incidence such as Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Infectious Diarrhea, though not leading to high mortality, bring to light significant morbidity which can strain healthcare systems and impact public health and economies due to loss of productivity and the cost of healthcare. Hepatitis remains a persistent health challenge, indicated by the combined morbidity across its types. While the immediate lethality is low, the long-term complications such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma pose serious health risks. Public concern is palpable around diseases with relatively lower incidence but higher mortality rates; Tuberculosis being a prime example with its far-reaching socio-economic consequences. Other diseases such as Hepatitis and AIDS also attract public concern due to their chronic nature and potential for severe health consequences. Despite no reported cases of Human infection with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses this month, the potential for avian influenza outbreaks remains a concern due to prior history and impact.

## Recommendations

Given the reported data and the context of public health concerns, we recommend that the public adhere strictly to personal hygiene practices to curb the transmission of diseases such as Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Infectious Diarrhea, which can be mitigated through such measures. Immunization for Hepatitis A and B should be actively promoted, as effective vaccines exist for these diseases. Additionally, the enhancement of routine screening and treatment accessibility for chronic infectious diseases like Hepatitis C, B and Tuberculosis, paired with public education campaigns, will be essential for early detection and care. The ongoing vigilance in monitoring avian influenza viruses is crucial. For diseases like AIDS, comprehensive strategies should expand beyond treatment to include prevention education, stigma reduction and community support programs.

Finally, an inter-sectoral approach involving health, education, and social services is imperative to effectively implement preventive measures, improve public awareness, and respond effectively to disease outbreaks. Intensifying research into vaccines and cures, especially for diseases without definitive preventative measures, should be a priority, alongside ongoing support for global health initiatives in disease monitoring and control.
