> **CNIDS: Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project**
> CNIDS is a project aimed at monitoring notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland. The project utilizes automated technology and data analysis methods to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities for infectious diseases, enabling timely measures to be taken to address potential public health risks.
> The primary objective of the CNIDS project is to establish an efficient infectious disease Surveillance system that enables real-time surveillance of legally notifiable infectious diseases and internet news. It provides decision-makers with timely information and recommendations to facilitate appropriate measures for disease control and prevention.

# Introduction

## Overview

January 2024 in the Chinese mainland saw a diverse array of infectious diseases impacting public health, with notable variations in case numbers and associated mortalities. Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) emerged as the most prevalent condition, with 155,696 reported cases, albeit resulting in a minimal number of fatalities (2). In contrast, the hepatitis spectrum also showed significant activity, with hepatitis B leading in numbers (110,266 cases, 45 deaths). It's crucial to highlight the discrepancy between case counts and death tolls across diseases, reflecting varying degrees of virulence and public health impact.

The death toll provides a stark reminder of the lethal potential of certain diseases, despite lower incidence rates. For instance, tuberculosis, despite not having the highest case count, resulted in a significant number of deaths (215), underscoring its severe health implications. Similarly, the human infection with the H7N9 virus, though only reporting a single case, led to a fatality, indicating the critical need for vigilance against seemingly less prevalent diseases.

## Concerns

The high incidence of HFMD, with over 155,000 cases, raises immediate concerns due to its rapid spread among children, necessitating urgent public health interventions. Despite the low mortality rate, the sheer volume of cases can strain healthcare resources and cause widespread societal concern, particularly among parents and schools. On the other hand, hepatitis B, with 110,266 cases and 45 deaths, remains a significant public health challenge due to its potential for chronic liver disease and cancer, highlighting the need for enhanced vaccination and awareness programs.

Public concern also gravitates towards diseases with lower incidence but higher fatality rates, such as tuberculosis, which reported 101,191 cases but led to 215 deaths. This discrepancy between case numbers and fatalities accentuates the lethal nature of tuberculosis, necessitating robust detection, treatment, and prevention strategies. The single case of human infection with the H7N9 virus resulting in death further exemplifies the critical nature of vigilance and preparedness against infectious diseases, even those with seemingly low prevalence.

## Recommendations

To mitigate the spread of HFMD, public health authorities should prioritize awareness campaigns targeting parents, schools, and childcare facilities, emphasizing the importance of hygiene practices such as regular handwashing and disinfection of shared surfaces. Additionally, the development and dissemination of guidelines for the management of HFMD in communal settings can help contain outbreaks and reduce transmission.

For hepatitis B, enhancing vaccination coverage is paramount. Efforts should focus on ensuring that all newborns receive the hepatitis B vaccine as part of their routine immunization schedule, coupled with public education campaigns to raise awareness about the disease, its transmission routes, and the importance of vaccination. For adults, targeted interventions, including screening and vaccination programs in high-risk populations, can significantly reduce the disease burden.

Given the severe implications of tuberculosis, strengthening the healthcare infrastructure for early detection and treatment is essential. This includes enhancing access to diagnostic facilities, promoting adherence to treatment regimens through patient education and support programs, and implementing rigorous contact tracing to prevent further spread. For emerging threats like the H7N9 virus, maintaining a robust surveillance system, coupled with rapid response capabilities, is crucial to identify and contain potential outbreaks at their onset.
