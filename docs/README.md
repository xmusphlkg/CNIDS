> **CNIDS: Chinese Notifiable Infectious Diseases Surveillance Project**
> CNIDS is a project aimed at monitoring notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland. The project utilizes automated technology and data analysis methods to enhance the monitoring and early warning capabilities for infectious diseases, enabling timely measures to be taken to address potential public health risks.
> The primary objective of the CNIDS project is to establish an efficient infectious disease Surveillance system that enables real-time surveillance of legally notifiable infectious diseases and internet news. It provides decision-makers with timely information and recommendations to facilitate appropriate measures for disease control and prevention.

# Introduction

# Overview

In November 2023, epidemiological data from mainland China's National Notifiable Disease Reporting System reflects a vast landscape of infectious diseases. The data indicates that some diseases continue to exert a significant health burden, both in terms of case numbers and associated mortality. Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), with 193,230 reported cases, stands out as the disease with the highest incidence, followed closely by infectious diarrhea (excluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever) and Hepatitis B. These illnesses demonstrate a persistent prevalence in China's population, highlighting the need for ongoing public health vigilance.

The mortality data for November 2023 reveals a more nuanced situation. While many diseases report zero or single-digit fatalities, certain conditions such as Tuberculosis (TB), with a reported 96106 cases and 171 deaths, and Hepatitis B, with 106985 cases and 40 deaths, remain causes of significant concern. Though the mortality rates for these diseases appear modest relative to their incident cases, they indicate the severity and impact of these infections on the Chinese population. The data underscores the necessity for effective treatment and management strategies to prevent disease progression and reduce mortality.

# Concerns

Diseases with high incidence such as HFMD and Hepatitis B reflect persistent public health challenges. HFMD, while often mild, poses significant risk to children and has resulted in rare but unfortunate complications leading to fatalities. The public health system must continue to address the vectors and conditions contributing to these high-incidence diseases through both preventative measures and accessible healthcare services.

Public concern, interestingly, may not always align with the diseases of highest incidence or mortality. For instance, while diseases like HFMD and Hepatitis B might register high within epidemiological data, emerging infectious diseases or those with a high-profile global presence—such as the new inclusion of Monkeypox into category B infectious diseases management—could draw significant public attention. Even if the numbers are comparatively lower, the perceived threat or novelty of such diseases can engender substantial concern, prompting the need for public education and preventive measures.

# Recommendations

To address the outlined diseases effectively, public health recommendations should be multifaceted:

1. For HFMD, vaccination programs targeting the causative viruses (Enteroviruses such as EV71 and Coxsackievirus) should be emphasized and coupled with public education campaigns about the importance of hygiene, especially in settings with young children. Efforts to enhance sanitation in schools, nurseries, and public spaces should be a priority, along with guidelines to manage outbreaks.

2. Hepatitis B, due to its high incidence and routes of transmission, warrants a continued and strengthened vaccination effort, especially for newborns and high-risk groups. Similarly, public awareness campaigns on safe practices to prevent transmission and the need for screening and early treatment should be intensified. Ensuring the availability of antiviral treatments can contribute to managing chronic infections and reducing the mortality associated with liver disease and hepatic carcinoma.

3. The recent addition of Monkeypox to category B infectious diseases management mandates a prompt establishment of surveillance systems and protocols for rapid identification, contact tracing, and isolation of cases to prevent outbreaks. Importantly, comprehensive communication strategies to inform the public about the symptoms, modes of transmission, and prevention techniques are necessary to alleviate undue fear or stigma and promote informed protective behaviors.

To summarize, these recommendations require collaboration between health authorities, healthcare providers, educators, and the community. Engagement and investment are vital to strengthen disease surveillance, vaccination programs, public education, and healthcare infrastructure to counter the prevalent and concerning diseases in China's diverse health landscape.
