# Mumps 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Mumps is a viral infection, primarily affecting salivary glands, transmitted through respiratory droplets or direct contact with an infected person. Notorious for its characteristic symptom of painful, swollen cheeks and jaw, mumps often occurs in children and young adults. Although most people recover within a couple of weeks, complications can include inflammation of the testicles, ovaries, breasts, and/or brain. Vaccination, specifically the MMR vaccine, is the most effective prevention strategy.

## Highlights

1. A significant decrease in mumps cases has been observed in mainland China, from peak monthly cases of around 70,000 in 2012 to around 10,000 in 2023. <br/>
2. There is a seasonal trend whereby cases rise in early summer (May-June) and decrease towards the end of the year. <br/>
3. Mumps' mortality is minimal, with an annual number of deaths frequently equating to single digits, implying a well-managed situation. <br/>
4. Recent data (2023) suggests a stabilized situation with monthly cases fluctuating around 7,000 - 11,000 and no reported deaths.

The Mumps case data for mainland China over the last 14 years demonstrates a distinctive seasonal pattern. The number of cases typically rebounds in spring and reaches its peak in summer, followed by a downward trend in autumn. After a trough in the winter, the cycle repeats. The highest recorded case count was seen in June 2012 at 71,606, which contrasts sharply with the low in February 2020 of 6,028 - likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic containment measures. Despite yearly fluctuations, there is a general downward trend in case numbers witnessed from 2010 to 2023.

The majority of the months had zero recorded deaths from Mumps, suggesting that the disease—while widespread—is generally not lethal, likely due to comprehensive childhood immunization programs. However, interestingly, the death count reached an all-year high of 4 deaths in January 2020, a date which coincides with the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Toward the tail end of the data sequence, we see a return to consistency with no recorded deaths from 2021 onwards. This underlines the exceptionally controlled nature of the Mumps disease in terms of mortality.
