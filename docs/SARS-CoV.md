# SARS-CoV 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a viral pathogen responsible for causing severe respiratory illness termed as SARS. Identified in 2003, the virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae, primarily zoonotic in origin, with bats being the natural reservoir. Transmission to humans typically involves intermediary hosts, and human-to-human spread is possible resulting in epidemics. The disease manifests with flu-like symptoms potentially progressing into severe pneumonia. Preventive measures include personal hygiene practices and the wearing of face masks. The SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002-2003 exhibited the importance of rapid public health response in controlling virus spread.
## Highlights

1. No reported SARS-CoV cases since data collection started in January 2010.<br/>
2. An anomaly, showing 1093 deaths in May 2012, despite zero cases reported. This may indicate a data entry error and needs review.<br/>
3. Data for January and February 2013 missing, but zero cases and deaths indicate no concerning trends in SARS-CoV before and after these months.<br/>
4. As of November 2023, the disease situation is stable with no new SARS-CoV infections or deaths for over a decade.<br/>

The provided data for SARS-CoV in mainland China shows an intriguing situation where no cases were reported from January 2010 to December 2023. It's a highly unusual occurrence given the prevalent epidemiological pattern of diseases. Such a situation could be owed to either successful implementation of preventive measures, or potential lapses in detection and reporting.

These figures starkly contrast with SARS-CoV related fatalities noted only in May 2012 where there were 1,093 deaths reported, despite there being zero cases mentioned during that period. This may indicate a possible retrospective addition of deaths previously undiagnosed or unreported, misclassification, or data error, as SARS-CoV requires infection for mortality. This peculiarity warrants further investigation.
