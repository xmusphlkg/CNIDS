# Rabies 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns:

Based on the provided data, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in the number of rabies cases and deaths in mainland China. Specifically, the number of cases and deaths tends to be higher during the summer and autumn months (June to October) and lower during the winter and spring months (November to May). This pattern suggests that there may be certain environmental or behavioral factors during the warmer months that contribute to the spread of rabies.

Peak and Trough Periods:

The peak period for rabies cases and deaths in mainland China typically occurs in September and October, when the number of cases and deaths reaches its highest point. Conversely, the trough period, when the number of cases and deaths is at its lowest, is usually observed in January and February.

Overall Trends:

An overall analysis of the data reveals a general decline in the number of rabies cases and deaths over the years. From 2010 to 2023, there is a noticeable decrease in the number of cases and deaths, with some fluctuations from year to year. This indicates that efforts to control and prevent rabies in mainland China have been effective in reducing the burden of the disease.

Discussion:

The observed seasonal patterns in the data suggest that certain factors, such as increased outdoor activities or higher animal population densities during the warmer months, may contribute to the transmission of rabies. This emphasizes the importance of implementing targeted prevention and control measures during peak periods to mitigate the risk of rabies transmission.

The overall decreasing trend in the number of cases and deaths is encouraging and indicates the success of strategies implemented to control rabies in mainland China. These strategies may include vaccination campaigns for both animals and humans, improved surveillance and reporting systems, and public education on rabies prevention and responsible pet ownership.

However, it is crucial to note that despite the decreasing trend, rabies remains a significant public health concern in mainland China. Continued efforts are necessary to maintain and strengthen the existing control measures, particularly in high-risk areas or populations. This includes ongoing surveillance, timely diagnosis and treatment of rabies cases, and promotion of responsible pet ownership and vaccination.

Overall, the analysis of the data highlights the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends of rabies cases and deaths in mainland China. It underscores the importance of sustained efforts in rabies prevention and control to further reduce the burden of this preventable disease.
## Introduction

Rabies is a viral zoonotic disease that causes progressive and acute encephalitis. The rabies virus is transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, commonly through bites or scratches. Domestic dogs are the most common reservoir of the virus, although it also circulates among wild mammals like bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes. Once clinical symptoms appear, rabies is virtually 100% fatal. Fortunately, it can be prevented through vaccination of animals and post-exposure prophylaxis in humans. Worldwide efforts to control rabies primarily focus on vaccinating dogs and providing education on prevention to at-risk communities.

## Highlights

- There has been a significant decline in both rabies cases and deaths in mainland China from January 2010 to October 2023, indicating effective disease control and prevention measures. <br/>
- The peak in rabies cases and deaths observed in the summer months (June-July) of earlier years has subsided, suggesting improved management during historically vulnerable periods. <br/>
- The years 2011-2012 saw higher numbers with a gradual reduction in subsequent years, with 2023 showing the lowest figures, indicating sustained progress over the last decade. <br/>
- The fatality rate remains high, as deaths closely follow the trend in cases, emphasizing the continued need for public health interventions, particularly in post-exposure prophylaxis and vaccination campaigns. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Rabies cases in mainland China, from January 2010 to October 2023, displayed a clear decrement. The initial year saw monthly cases as high as 233, with a significant decrease over time. By 2023, monthly cases were consistently below 20. This reduction could suggest improved vaccination, increased public awareness, and better control of rabid animal populations. Seasonal fluctuations were evident, with summer months often experiencing a rise in cases—potentially linked to increased human-animal interactions.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to rabies in China from 2010 to 2023 reflect a similar descending trend as seen with cases. Initially, the months recorded death counts surpassing 100, peaking at 208 in November 2010, which dwindle to single digits by 2023. This trend signifies that the public health response has effectively reduced mortality, likely through post-exposure prophylaxis and education. Nonetheless, the proportion of cases resulting in death remained high throughout, likely indicating underreporting of cases or delays in accessing treatment.
