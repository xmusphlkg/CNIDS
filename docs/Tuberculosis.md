# Tuberculosis 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, there is evidence of a seasonal pattern in the number of tuberculosis cases in mainland China. The incidence tends to be higher during the winter months (December to February) and lower during the summer months (June to August). This pattern consistently occurs over multiple years.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
The peak period for tuberculosis cases in mainland China is observed during the winter months, particularly in January and February. During these months, the incidence reaches its highest levels. Conversely, the trough period occurs during the summer months, with the lowest number of cases observed in July and August.

Overall Trends: 
There is an overall downward trend in the number of tuberculosis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. While the number of cases fluctuates from year to year, there is a general decrease. It is important to note, however, that there was a sudden decline in reported cases in 2013, with negative values recorded for January and February. This decline may be a result of data reporting issues or other factors that affected data collection during that period.

Discussion: 
The seasonal pattern of tuberculosis cases in mainland China aligns with the known transmission dynamics of the disease. Tuberculosis is transmitted through the air, and factors such as increased indoor crowding and reduced ventilation during the winter months may contribute to higher transmission rates.

The overall decreasing trend in tuberculosis cases over the years is a positive indication that efforts to control and prevent the disease have been successful. Nevertheless, continued monitoring and implementation of interventions are crucial to further reduce the burden of tuberculosis in mainland China.

It is important to highlight that the sudden decrease in reported cases in 2013, with negative values recorded for January and February, raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data during that period. Further investigation and verification of the data may be necessary to ensure the validity of the findings.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends of tuberculosis cases in mainland China. Continuous surveillance and targeted interventions are vital to further alleviate the burden of tuberculosis in the country.
## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Primarily affecting the lungs (pulmonary TB), it can also impact other body parts (extrapulmonary TB). TB is among the top infectious disease killers globally, spreading through airborne particles, typically from coughs or sneezes. Symptoms include a persistent cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Diagnosis may involve skin tests, blood tests, chest X-rays, and sputum analysis. Treatment usually requires a long course of multiple antibiotics. Efforts to control TB include vaccination, public health initiatives, and improving socio-economic conditions.

## Highlights

- Tuberculosis (TB) cases and deaths in mainland China show substantial variability over the years, with a notable overall decline in cases from 2010 to 2023. <br/>
- The highest peak observed was in March 2010 with 138,574 cases, while the lowest number of cases was reported in October 2023, with 59,239 cases. <br/>
- Deaths due to TB have fluctuated and significantly increased from a monthly count of under 200 in earlier years to exceeding 300 per month in 2023, peaking at 354 deaths in October 2023 despite the reduced case counts. <br/>
- This pattern suggests improved case detection or reporting over time, though the rising mortality rate indicates potential challenges in TB management or a shift in the disease severity. <br/>

Between January 2010 and October 2023, the monthly reported tuberculosis (TB) cases in mainland China demonstrated variability, with a peak in March 2012 (138,683 cases) and a notable decrease in December 2022 (33,951 cases). A preliminary inspection indicates seasonal trends with higher numbers in March/April and lower counts during winter months. A sudden drop in reported cases began in February 2020, possibly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent restrictions affecting TB case detection and reporting.

The number of TB-related deaths also fluctuated throughout the observed period, with an overall upward trend peaking in October 2023 (354 deaths). There is a notable increase in fatalities from January 2022 onwards, with death count more than doubling compared to earlier years. This could suggest a worsening of case severity, reporting practices, an aging population, or healthcare system challenges. The spike in deaths despite lower case numbers could indicate delayed or reduced access to healthcare services, potentially due to the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic.
