# Japanese encephalitis 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern. The number of cases tends to rise from May to August, reaching its peak in August. Subsequently, the number gradually declines, with lower figures observed from September to December. During January to April, the number of cases remains relatively low.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
August stands as the peak period for Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China, with the highest number of reported cases occurring during this month. Conversely, the trough period, characterized by the lowest number of cases, typically spans from January to April.

Overall Trends: 
In general, the number of Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China demonstrates an upward trend from 2010 to 2013. Cases peak in 2013, followed by a gradual decline until 2016. Subsequently, there is a minor increase in cases from 2016 to 2018, succeeded by a decrease in 2019. From 2019 to 2023, the number of cases remains relatively stable, with intermittent fluctuations.

Discussion: 
The seasonal pattern of Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China aligns with the recognized transmission dynamics of the disease. Mosquitoes primarily transmit Japanese encephalitis, and the peak in cases during the summer months corresponds to heightened mosquito activity. The decline in cases during winter months likely results from reduced mosquito activity.

The overall trend of Japanese encephalitis cases exhibits fluctuations over the years, characterized by periods of increase and decrease. Various factors, such as changes in mosquito populations, vaccination coverage, and public health interventions, could influence this pattern. Consequently, it is crucial to continuously monitor and implement preventive measures to alleviate the burden of Japanese encephalitis in mainland China.
## Introduction

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes, primarily Culex species. The virus responsible originates from the Flaviviridae family, which also includes dengue and yellow fever. JE is prevalent in rural and agricultural regions of Asia and the Western Pacific. The disease primarily affects the central nervous system, causing inflammation of the brain. While most infections are mild or asymptomatic, approximately 1 in 250 cases evolves into severe clinical illness. Symptoms include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, and potentially death. Vaccination is the most effective preventive measure against JE.

## Highlights

- Significant seasonal variation is observed, with case spikes typically in July and August, correlating with mosquito activity. <br/>
- Over the years, there is a notable decrease in cases and deaths, indicative of effective disease control measures. <br/>
- Despite a general downward trend, occasional surges (e.g., August 2018) imply the need for continued vigilance. <br/>
- The current situation as of October 2023 shows a reduced number of cases and deaths, suggesting improvements in public health interventions and vaccination. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The distribution of Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 exhibits a clear seasonal trend with a peak during the months of July and August each year, corresponding to the mosquito breeding season. While there is variability in cases year-on-year, there seems to be a gradual decrease from the pronounced peak of 1,301 cases in August 2010. Data from 2023 indicates a continued presence of infection, albeit much lower at 80 cases in August. The seasonality and declining trend suggest effective vector control and vaccination strategies may be at play.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality associated with Japanese encephalitis in mainland China also reflects a seasonal pattern, with higher death counts typically in the summer months when case numbers surge. Over the years, the deadliest month was August 2018, with 55 deaths. Although not as dramatic as case numbers, death counts also exhibit a decreasing trend. Moreover, the case fatality rate (CFR) appears to fluctuate, with some years like 2019 showing higher CFR despite lower cases, suggesting variations in either disease reporting, virulence, or access to healthcare.
