# Gonorrhea 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The disease can infect both men and women, impacting mucous membranes such as the throat, genitals or rectum. Symptoms may include painful urination, discharge, or the absence of symptoms altogether. Transmission occurs primarily through sexual contact. If untreated, it can lead to severe health complications, including infertility. Worldwide, over 87 million new cases are estimated each year.
## Highlights

1. Throughout the years, there is a consistent rise in the number of Gonorrhea cases with some fluctuations. From 8865 cases in January 2010 to an overall increase reaching 10065 cases in November 2023, depicting a slow upward trend over 13 years. <br/>
2. Deaths related to Gonorrhea are relatively low and sporadic over the years and no consistent pattern can be observed. Notably, the record number of deaths was four in January 2020, otherwise the number usually did not exceed one. <br/>
3. There is a significant drop in cases in the early part of 2020, potentially linked with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restriction measures leading to a decrease interaction and transmission opportunities. <br/>
4. After the dip in 2020, there's an increase trend resuming until November 2023, although not reaching the pre-pandemic peaks. Future monitoring will determine if this trend continues. <br/>

The cases of Gonorrhea in mainland China demonstrate a noticeable fluctuating pattern over the years, with the counts experiencing seasonal variations. The months with typically higher case counts are June to August. Moreover, there is a discernible downward trend in cases in early 2020, likely associated with enhanced preventive measures during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, a general trend from 2010 to 2023 illustrates an increase in reported cases, indicating a possible rise in transmission or improvements in detection and reporting over time.

Despite the fluctuating case count, deaths due to Gonorrhea remain consistently low, with many months recording no fatalities. However, notable exceptions appear in September 2012, January 2023, and a few isolated instances throughout the period. These fatalities might be linked to underlying health complications or limited access to health services during those months. It's plausible that the introduction of more effective treatments and prevention strategies over the years has helped in keeping the death count low.
