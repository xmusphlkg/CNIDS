# Hepatitis E 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E virus (HEV), primarily spread through contaminated water or food. The infection is usually short-term and resolves within 4-6 weeks, but can be severe in certain populations, especially pregnant women. Globally, there are approximately 20 million HEV infections each year, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E. Although vaccines have been developed, they are not widely available, making prevention measures crucial.
## Highlights

- A gradual decrease in Hepatitis E cases from a peak in March 2011 (4262 cases) to November 2023 (2751 cases), indicating improvement in disease management over the years. <br/>
- A generally low mortality rate throughout the years, often maintaining at or near zero deaths per month, showcasing effective clinical intervention or low disease virulence. <br/>
- Persistent cyclical fluctuations in case numbers with peaks typically observed in the spring months (March, April), suggesting seasonal patterns in transmission. <br/>
- An abrupt reduction in cases during early 2020, which may correlate with public health measures for COVID-19, hinting at the impact of broad health interventions on other infectious diseases. <br/>

The data trend for Hepatitis E cases in China from 2010 to 2023 shows fluctuating patterns with notable peaks generally in March, which may suggest seasonal variability. The highest number of recorded cases occurred in March 2011 with 4,262 cases, while 2022 December had the lowest case count at 1,187. The apparent decline in cases at the beginning of 2020 correlates with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially indicating impacts from public health interventions such as lockdowns or reporting changes.

The death toll associated with Hepatitis E from 2010 through 2023 has remained low relative to the number of cases, suggesting a low case-fatality rate. The highest number of deaths in a single month was six, occurring in February 2010, March 2010, and December 2017. A total of eight years (including 2011 August to December due to missing data) witnessed months with zero mortality. Throughout the observed period, there are no clear trends indicating an increase or decrease in fatalities, implying a consistently low disease lethality or uniform management efficacy.
