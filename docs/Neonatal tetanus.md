# Neonatal tetanus

Version: November 2023

## Introduction

Neonatal tetanus is a severe bacterial infection affecting newborns, predominantly in areas with limited healthcare resources. It's caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, primarily introduced through non-sterile delivery and umbilical cord care practices. In untreated cases, the toxins produced by the bacteria lead to severe, life-threatening muscular rigidity and spasms. Neonatal tetanus is highly preventable through maternal immunization, hygienic birth practices, and proper cord care.

## Highlights

1. A significant decrease in both neonatal tetanus cases and deaths was observed from 2010-2023 in Chinese mainland.<br/>
2. From 89 cases in January 2010 to just 1 case in November 2023, this showcases successful public health interventions.<br/>
3. Deaths due to neonatal tetanus also fell drastically, indicating improved clinical treatment and early disease management.<br/>
4. Despite low cases, continuous vigilance, vaccination, and prompt treatment remain crucial to maintain these results.<br/>

From 2010 to 2023, Chinese mainland witnessed a noticeable decrease in Neonatal tetanus cases. A high of 120 cases in September and October of 2010 gradually fell to single-digit figures by 2023, suggesting effective control strategies. However, the trend highlights fluctuations, with certain periods of significant reductions, such as from 2010 to 2011 and then another steep drop after 2016, implying the influence of potential drivers like widespread immunization or health campaigns.

The number of deaths due to Neonatal tetanus also showed a significant decline over time. While deaths were relatively consistent in the initial years, with a peak of 12 in February 2010, no fatalities were reported from 2017 onwards, hinting at improved medical treatment methods and effective interventions. Nonetheless, isolated instances of deaths reappeared in latter years, signalling the need for sustained attention despite lower incidences.
