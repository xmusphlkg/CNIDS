# Infectious diarrhea 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea is a condition caused by a host of bacteria, viruses, and parasites, which enter the body primarily through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Symptoms often include frequent loose or watery stools, abdominal cramps, and nausea, with potential dehydration as a serious complication. The disease is particularly prevalent in regions with inadequate sanitation and can be life-threatening, especially for children and the immunocompromised. Prevention strategies include safe food handling, proper hand hygiene, and access to clean water. Vaccinations and prompt treatment can mitigate the impact of certain pathogens responsible for infectious diarrhea.

## Highlights

- Infectious diarrhea in mainland China has displayed strong seasonality with peaks generally occurring in the hot, summer months (June, July, and August) and a decrease in cases in the colder, winter months. <br/>
- Despite the seasonality, a general increasing trend of cases can be observed from the start period in 2010 to a peak in 2018, followed by an overall decreasing trend up to the current period in 2023. <br/>
- Mortality due to infectious diarrhea is notably low, indicating effective medical interventions and overall public health response to manage the disease. <br/>
- As of September 2023, there were 102,559 cases with no recorded deaths, which is relatively lower compared to the last two years within the same month.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows seasonal variability to infectious diarrhea cases in mainland China. Each year, cases tend to rise from April/May, peak around June/July, and gradually fall through winter. The disease exhibits cyclical behavior, with cases increasing during the warmer months, indicating a probable link with environmental factors, such as temperature and precipitation. Notably, cases drastically increased in 2011, maintaining high values through 2013. In 2014 the pattern seemed to normalize but started increasing again steadily from 2016 to 2018. Even though there seem to be reductions, the total number of cases over the years remains comparatively high.

### Deaths Analysis
In contrast with the high number of cases, the death count remains remarkably low throughout, never exceeding seven deaths per month. While the death rate varies little across seasons, some years observed higher death counts like 2010 and 2014. The death rate has decreased significantly over time, reaching zero deaths/month repeatedly after 2015. The low mortality rate could possibly suggest effective measures in place to deal with severe cases, like prompt treatment strategies, health education, and improved public health infrastructure, despite the high incidence of the disease.
