# Poliomyelitis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, also known as polio, is an infectious viral disease that primarily affects children under five years old. It predominantly spreads through fecal-oral transmission, meaning contaminated food, water, or direct contact with an infected person's feces. The virus targets the nervous system and can lead to paralysis. Technically, there is no cure for polio but it can be prevented through immunization. The World Health Organization's Polio Eradication Program has significantly reduced global cases since its launch in 1988.
## Highlights

- Poliomyelitis outbreak occurred in 2011 with 20 cases and 1 death; no subsequent cases or deaths reported from December 2011 to November 2023. <br/>
- Long-term absence of cases post-outbreak reflects the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and public health strategies in mainland China. <br/>
- Current data indicates Poliomyelitis has been successfully eliminated in China, with sustained efforts to maintain high immunization coverage and vigilant surveillance. <br/>
- Emphasis remains on preventing virus re-emergence through routine immunization and monitoring, ensuring continued disease control.

The data indicates a sustained absence of poliomyelitis cases in Chinese mainland from January 2010 until an outbreak occurred in August 2011 with 4 cases. This was followed by a spike in September and October, with 6 and 8 cases respectively, suggesting localized transmission. After October, cases dropped to 2 in December and then returned to zero. From January 2012 onwards, no further cases have been reported, illustrating effective outbreak control and likely high immunization coverage maintaining polio-free status.

Poliomyelitis-related mortality in the Chinese mainland is minimal, with the data showing only one death between January 2010 and November 2023. This solitary death occurred in September 2011 amidst an outbreak that year. The lack of subsequent deaths suggests successful clinical management of cases and possibly mild disease presentation. The absence of further mortality underscores the effectiveness of preventative public health measures and the eradication of poliovirus transmission in this region.
