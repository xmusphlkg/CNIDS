# Poliomyelitis

Version: November 2023

## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, often termed polio, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. The virus can lead to paralysis by infecting a person's nervous system. Predominantly affecting children under 5, transmission occurs mainly through person-to-person contact, particularly the fecal-oral route. While infected individuals are most contagious immediately before and after symptoms appear, the infection can go unrecognized as symptoms vary from mild, flu-like signs to debilitating paralysis. Immunization through vaccines is the primary prevention method.

## Highlights

1. No new cases of Poliomyelitis were reported from 2010 to early 2011. However, there was a spike in cases from August to October 2011, with one death reported in September of the same year. <br/>
2. Following the 2011 outbreak, the situation appears to stabilize, with no polio cases or deaths reported in the subsequent years up to November 2023, indicating sustained disease control measures. <br/>
3. The unbroken streak of zero cases since late 2011 up to the latest data point of November 2023 suggests that polio might be nearing eradication in Chinese mainland. <br/>
4. Nevertheless, continued surveillance is vital, given the disease's potential for transmission even in polio-free areas due to international travel and migration. <br/>

The data indicates a strong control of poliomyelitis in Chinese mainland with the majority of months reporting no cases. However, there's a noticeable surge of reported cases in August, September, and October of 2011; with 4, 6, and 8 cases respectively. Following that, reported cases returned rapidly to zero, demonstrating effective public health interventions. The absence of reported cases in the following years underscores the effectiveness of the polio eradication efforts.

The low mortality from poliomyelitis is evident in the data, with only a single reported death in September 2011 at the same time as the peak in case reports. This suggests adequate healthcare response and treatment capabilities during the outbreak. No further deaths were reported in the subsequent months to the present, reflecting effective disease control and prevention strategies in mitigating the deadly potential of poliomyelitis.
