# Acquired immune deficiency syndrome 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening illness caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It interferes with the body's ability to fight infections and diseases by attacking the immune system, particularly CD4 cells. Over time, HIV can destroy so many CD4 cells that the body is unable to fend off infections and diseases, leading to the development of AIDS. Transmission primarily occurs through unprotected sex, contaminated blood transfusions, or from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding.
## Highlights

1. There is a general upward trend in both the number of cases and deaths from AIDS in mainland China between 2010 and 2023, indicating an ongoing public health issue. <br/>
2. The data shows a cyclic pattern: a surge in cases from mid to late each year, followed by a drop at the start of the new year. Similar trend is reflected in the death count. <br/>
3. As of November 2023, the number of reported new cases and deaths are 5664 and 1955 respectively, which compared to the same month in previous years is relatively high. <br/>
4. The case fatality ratio (deaths as a proportion of cases) has been fluctuating over the years, yet exhibits a generally increasing trend, requiring further investigation. <br/>

Looking at the data from 2010 to 2023, there is an overall rising trend in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cases reported in mainland China. The peak is observed at 7897 in December 2018. Despite some fluctuations, the number of new cases presented a consistent growth over the years. Seasonality can also be observed, with a higher number of cases often being reported around December, which may be attributed to increased testing during World AIDS Day, December 1st.

Comparable to the reported cases, deaths due to AIDS also reflect an increasing trend with the highest mortality reported as 2486 in December of 2021. The mortality figures continue to reflect the contractions in the number of new reported cases, indicating a correlation between newly reported cases and subsequent deaths. It can be deduced that this trend maybe due to late diagnosis, limited accessibility to treatment, or treatment discontinuation, potentially due to stigma or other sociocultural factors. Despite improvement in treatments, this trend underlines the need for enhanced preventive measures and early identification.
