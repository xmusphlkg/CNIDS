# Acquired immune deficiency syndrome 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, life-threatening disease caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It weakens the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections and diseases. HIV proliferates by destroying white blood cells (T cells), disrupting the body's ability to fight off diseases. Transmission can occur through unprotected sex, sharing needles, or from mother to child during birth or breastfeeding. No cure exists, though antiretroviral therapy can control the virus and prevent progression.

## Highlights

1. The data shows a general increase in both cases and deaths due to AIDS in mainland China from 2010 to 2023<br/>
2. Notably, there is a marked ascent in the number of deaths in 2022 and 2023, despite cases not showing a similar sharp rise<br/>
3. The data suggests periods of higher transmission and death rates in months like December and November since 2010<br/>
4. There's substantial seasonal variation, independent of long-term trends, with higher case counts typically in the months of May - July.<br/>

From 2010 to 2023, the reported cases of Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in mainland China showed an overall increasing trend with some fluctuations. The number of cases initially hovered around 2000-4000 per month but gradually increased over the years, peaking at almost 7900 cases in December of 2018. Interestingly, February seemed to consistently have lower case numbers as compared to other months, potentially due to the shortened month length. This data implies there has been a sustained level of AIDS transmission over the years amid certain mitigating factors.

Similar to cases, AIDS-related deaths also increased over the years with observable fluctuations. Deaths were generally increasing across the board, starting from about 500 per month in 2010 to upwards of 2000 per month in the last reported years. The highest number of deaths reached approximately 2500 in December 2021. However, while the trend generally mirrors that of reported cases, it is also noticeable that in the initial years, the death ratio was relatively higher compared to later years, potentially indicating advances in treatment and management of the disease over time.
