# Hepatitis 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Hepatitis is a medical condition characterized by inflammation of the liver, primarily caused by different strains of hepatitis viruses labeled A, B, C, D, and E. Exposure routes include contaminated food or water, blood transfusions, sexual contact, or during childbirth. Symptoms may range from mild fatigue to severe liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. While vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B, treatment for other types requires medication. Prevention emphasizes on good hygiene, safe sex, and vaccination.
## Highlights

- Upward trend in Hepatitis cases: November 2023 reports a high of 156,977 cases, significantly up from 72,630 in December 2022. <br/>
- Sharply increased fatalities: Deaths have escalated dramatically to 327 in November 2023, starkly higher than previous years, indicating increased disease severity or health system challenges. <br/>
- Seasonal case fluctuations: Monthly data show peaks and troughs, hinting at seasonal impacts on transmission or irregularities in case reporting. <br/>
- Elevated morbidity and mortality in late 2023: The rise in both cases and deaths in the latter part of the year signals an urgent need for public health intervention. <br/>

The data on Hepatitis cases in the Chinese mainland from January 2010 until November 2023 show a significant fluctuation in infection rates. Specifically, March and July tend to report higher cases almost every year, possibly suggesting seasonal patterns. The highest recorded cases are in August 2023 with 166,606 cases. There's a notable decrease in cases reported in December 2022; however, an upward trend is observed in the following months, peaking in November 2023. The spike in cases over this period could indicate an outbreak or improved surveillance and reporting systems.

Reported Hepatitis-related deaths remained relatively stable from 2010 to 2022, with numbers generally staying below 100 per month. However, starting in May 2023, there's a troubling escalation in fatalities, reaching a peak in November 2023 with 327 deaths. The gradual increase in mortality rate in 2023, rising by nearly 300% from January to November, suggests a worsening of either the virulence of the pathogen, the vulnerability of the population, healthcare capacity issues, or a combination of these factors. This warrants an urgent epidemiological investigation to identify the cause and implement appropriate public health measures.
