# Hand foot and mouth disease 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a contagious illness caused by different types of viruses. Predominantly affecting children, it presents symptoms such as fever, sore throat, followed by blisters on the hands, feet, mouth and sometimes buttocks and legs. The disease is transmitted through direct contact with nasal discharge, saliva, feces, and fluid from the blisters of an affected person. There's no specific treatment, but symptoms can be eased with medication. Prevention includes practicing good hygiene like frequent hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces.
## Highlights

- Seasonal peaks in HFMD are observed from April to July, with a significant surge to 457,212 cases in July 2023. <br/>
- A marked decrease in HFMD incidence and mortality in 2023, with zero deaths from January to November and cases peaking at 92,955 in November, compared to previous years. <br/>
- The reduction in cases and fatalities since 2020 coincides with the onset of COVID-19, suggesting an impact from public health interventions. <br/>
- Successful containment of HFMD by 2023 is evident, with no recorded deaths, showcasing the effectiveness of health measures and treatments. <br/>

The data for Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in China from 2010 to 2023 reflects a clear seasonal pattern, with caseloads peaking during May and June each year, coinciding with warmer months. Overall, cases surged annually until 2012, with the highest number recorded in May 2012 (462,116 cases). Post-2012, although fluctuations persist, there’s a trend of gradual decline, particularly from 2020 onwards, where cases plummet dramatically, likely due to COVID-19 pandemic measures. The substantial decrease in 2020 continues with only slight upticks observed thereafter.

Fatalities due to HFMD present a proportional trend to the number of cases, with highest deaths in months with peak cases, particularly from April to July each year. The deadliest month throughout this period was May 2010, with 186 deaths. Since then, although cases remained high, the fatality rate decreased, indicating improved management and treatment. From 2020, deaths are nearly nil, which could be again attributed to intensified health measures during COVID-19. This suggests potentially better surveillance, healthcare responses, and public health interventions over the years.
