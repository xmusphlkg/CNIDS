# Hand foot and mouth disease 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns:

Based on the provided data, there is a clear seasonal pattern observed for Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in mainland China. The number of cases tends to rise during the spring and summer months, reaching its peak between May and July. Following this, there is a gradual decrease in cases during the fall and winter months, with the lowest activity occurring between December and February.

Peak and Trough Periods:

In mainland China, the peak period for HFMD cases usually occurs from May to July, with the highest number of reported cases during this time. Conversely, the trough period, which corresponds to the period with the lowest number of cases, is typically seen between December and February.

Overall Trends:

From 2010 to 2023, there has been an increasing trend in HFMD cases in mainland China. The number of cases has fluctuated over the years, with some years experiencing higher peaks than others. Nevertheless, a general upward trend in reported cases is evident.

Discussion:

The seasonal pattern of HFMD in mainland China aligns with the known characteristics of the disease. HFMD is known to be more prevalent during warmer months, as the causative viruses, such as enterovirus, thrive in higher temperatures. The peak period in May to July coincides with the summer season when children are more likely to be in close contact, increasing the risk of transmission.

The overall increasing trend in HFMD cases may be attributed to various factors, including enhanced surveillance and reporting systems, greater awareness and diagnosis of the disease, and changes in population dynamics. It is important to note that variations in reporting practices and testing capabilities across different regions of mainland China contribute to the observed fluctuations in case numbers.

Further analysis and investigation are necessary to understand the specific factors driving the increasing trend and to develop effective prevention and control strategies for HFMD in mainland China.
## Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a contagious viral infection common in children and characterized by sores in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet. It is most frequently caused by coxsackievirus A16 and enterovirus 71. HFMD spreads through contact with an infected person's nasal secretions, saliva, fluid from blisters, or stool. Symptoms include fever, reduced appetite, sore throat, and a feeling of being unwell, followed by painful sores in the mouth and a rash with blisters on hands, feet, and sometimes buttocks. It typically resolves on its own within 7-10 days.

## Highlights

- Seasonal peaks observed every year, with the highest number of cases typically occurring from May to July, suggesting a robust seasonality pattern for Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD). <br/>
- A dramatic decrease in cases and deaths in 2020, potentially due to public health interventions for COVID-19 such as social distancing, which could have inadvertently impacted HFMD transmission. <br/>
- Post-2020, the number of cases gradually rebounded to pre-pandemic patterns by 2023, possibly due to relaxation of COVID-19 measures and resumption of normal activities. <br/>
- No reported deaths from HFMD in mainland China since the substantial decline in cases in 2020, indicating improved disease management or reporting. <br/>

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) cases in mainland China show notable seasonality with peaks in June and July, reflecting typical enterovirus transmission patterns. Starting in 2010 with substantial monthly variations, cases dramatically increased to over 300,000 during warm months, signaling conducive conditions for viral spread. Reported cases reached their zenith in 2014, followed by a general decline through 2019. A substantial drop in 2020 aligns with COVID-19 pandemic interventions, affecting HFMD incidence due to lockdowns and heightened hygiene practices. The uptrend resumes in 2021 and continues into 2023.

Deaths associated with HFMD in China exhibit a generally decreasing trend over the years. The highest mortality was recorded in 2010, with a death count peaking at 186 in May. Subsequently, yearly peaks persist but with a lower frequency and magnitude, signaling improved disease management and possible increases in population immunity or virulence changes. The impressive reduction in deaths from 2020 onwards, with zero deaths in many months, likely corresponds to reduced transmission due to COVID-19 control measures and possibly improvements in healthcare. By 2023, HFMD-related mortality remains minimal, showing effective ongoing control and response efforts.
