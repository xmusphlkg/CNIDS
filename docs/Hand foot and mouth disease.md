# Hand foot and mouth disease 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a contagious illness typically caused by the Coxsackie virus. It primarily affects children and is characterized by sores in the mouth, as well as a rash on the hands and feet. HFMD is transmitted through direct contact with nasal secretions, saliva, blister fluid, and feces of infected individuals. It generally occurs in epidemics during the summer and early autumn. Mild self-limiting symptoms include fever, loss of appetite, malaise, and may be accompanied by respiratory symptoms.

## Highlights

1. There has been a marked reduction in cases and fatalities over the last decade, indicating progress towards disease control.<br/>
2. Consistent seasonal trends are observed across the years, with cases peaking during April to July, highlighting the necessity of heightened surveillance during these months.<br/>
3. Despite the general decrease in cases, there was a significant surge in numbers during June and July 2023, emphasizing the continued need for vigilance and preventive measures.<br/>
4. Deaths from Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease have reached a record low in November 2023, signalling enhanced public health interventions.<br/>

The data signals a cyclic pattern in the incidence of Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in mainland China. It typically shows an increasing trend at the start of the year, with a notable peak generally around May or June, followed by a gradual decrease towards the end of the year. This trend may have a strong correlation with the climatic changes since the disease is more prevalent in warmer weathers. A remarkable exception is observed in the data for 2020 where there was a significant dip in the cases, possibly due to preventive measures taken during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Death rates from HFMD are relatively low, with the highest recorded in April 2010 at 175. There is no distinct pattern in the fatality rates, but they generally appear to follow the trend of case occurrence, albeit at a much lower frequency. The number of deaths seems to decrease over time, which suggests an improved response to the disease, possibly due to better healthcare provisions and public awareness. It's also noteworthy that no fatalities were reported from 2020 onwards, potentially representing the positive impact of stricter hygiene measures during the COVID-19 crisis.
