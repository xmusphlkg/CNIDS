# Plague 

Version: October 2023 

Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, no clear seasonal pattern is observed for Plague cases and deaths in mainland China. The number of cases and deaths fluctuates throughout the years without consistent patterns.

Peak and Trough Periods:
Multiple peak periods are observed for both cases and deaths of Plague in mainland China. In terms of cases, peaks occurred in June 2010, September 2010, October 2010, September 2011, October 2011, July 2014, August 2020, and August 2023. For deaths, the peak periods were in June 2010, September 2011, July 2014, August 2020, and August 2023. Trough periods, characterized by relatively low numbers of cases and deaths, are observed in various months throughout the years.

Overall Trends:
Plague cases and deaths in mainland China show relatively low and sporadic trends. There is no significant increase or decrease in the number of cases and deaths over the years. However, there are a few notable spikes in cases and deaths in certain months, but these do not represent sustained trends.

Discussion:
The provided data does not reveal a clear seasonal pattern for Plague cases and deaths in mainland China. The number of cases and deaths fluctuates throughout the years without a consistent pattern. It is important to note that the data is limited to the period before October 2023, and there may be other factors influencing the occurrence of Plague cases and deaths in mainland China that are not captured in this dataset. Further analysis and investigation would be necessary to understand the underlying factors contributing to the sporadic nature of Plague cases and deaths in mainland China.
## Introduction

Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, typically found in small mammals and their fleas. It can manifest in three different forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. The bubonic form is most common, characterized by swollen lymph nodes or "buboes." Transmission occurs through flea bites or direct contact with contaminated fluids or tissues and, for pneumonic plague, through inhalation of infected droplets. Historically, plague has caused widespread pandemics, including the Black Death in the 14th century. It is treatable with antibiotics if diagnosed early.

## Highlights

- Sporadic cases of plague have occurred in China with 15 reported incidents from 2010-2023, suggesting low endemicity but persistence of risk. <br/>
- Mortality was recorded in 9 out of 15 occurrences, indicating a high case-fatality rate when infections do happen. <br/>
- Notable spikes in cases and deaths were seen in November 2019 and August 2020, emphasizing periodic surges in transmission or reporting. <br/>
- The most recent surge in August 2023, with 4 cases and 1 death, signals the need for continued surveillance and prompt public health response. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Plague cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 demonstrate sporadic occurrences with a total of 21 reported cases over this 13-year span. Notably, cases occurred singularly in various months across the years, without clear seasonality or a sustained outbreak pattern. 2019 and 2020 showed relative peaks with four and three cases, respectively. The temporal distribution indicates random, isolated cases without an indication of a progressive endemic or epidemic trend within these years.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality data reveals a total of 10 deaths from 2010 to 2023, signifying a high case-fatality ratio, common for plague without prompt treatment. Deaths occurred in the same month as cases about 50% of the time, suggesting rapid disease progression or coinciding discovery and reporting of cases already at a terminal stage. Limited data provided does not establish a trend of increasing lethality or frequency of lethal cases over time, which may reflect constant mortality risks or effective responses in isolated cases.
