# Human infection with H5N1 virus 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Human infection with H5N1 virus, commonly known as avian influenza or "bird flu," is a highly pathogenic disease that primarily affects birds but can also infect humans and other animals. The virus is transmitted to humans through direct contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Since its first report in humans in 1997, it has resulted in serious illness and high mortality rate. H5N1 infection in humans can cause severe respiratory symptoms, including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and death.
## Highlights

- Sporadic cases of H5N1 with occasional fatalities were observed from June 2010 through 2023, indicating intermittent human exposure to the virus. <br/>
- A notable cluster of cases occurred in early 2015 with 7 cases and 4 deaths, suggesting a temporary surge in virus transmission or detection. <br/>
- The overall incidence and fatality rate appears low, with only 9 cases and 7 deaths recorded over the 13-year period, demonstrating limited human-to-human transmission. <br/>
- As of November 2023, no new cases or deaths have been reported, indicating that the situation is currently stable, but continued vigilance is required to monitor for possible outbreaks.

From 2010 to 2023, the Chinese mainland has reported sporadic human cases of H5N1 virus infection. A solitary case occurred in June 2010, followed by equally isolated occurrences in December 2011, January 2012, and then a few sporadic incidents from 2014 through 2016. A slight surge is seen in early 2015 with seven cases within five months, indicating possible episodic outbreaks. The data then reflects a three-year hiatus before another isolated case in September 2022, and one more in February 2023, signifying rare but persistent risk.

The mortality associated with H5N1 cases in China from 2010 to 2023 underscores the high fatality rate when infections do occur. Deaths align with reported cases, with the first recorded in June 2010. Each year that saw cases also witnessed fatalities, emphasizing lethality. Notable is the period from January to May 2015, where four cases led to three deaths. The years 2017 through 2021 recorded no fatalities, suggesting effective containment or surveillance. The most recent death, identified in February 2016, potentially indicates improved clinical management of sporadic cases.
