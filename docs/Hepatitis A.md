# Hepatitis A 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus. It often spreads through ingestion of contaminated food and water or close contact with an infected person. Symptoms, appearing 2-6 weeks after exposure, include fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and jaundice. While rarely resulting in death, it can cause severe symptoms and liver damage. Vaccination is the most effective method of prevention, along with maintaining good hygiene and safe food practices. Unlike other types of viral hepatitis, Hepatitis A does not cause chronic liver disease.
## Highlights

- Declining trend in Hepatitis A cases over 13 years, with cases reducing from 2379 in January 2010 to 1056 in November 2023, indicating effective control measures. <br/>
- Low mortality rate associated with the disease, often zero, except for an anomalous spike of 56 deaths in May 2012. <br/>
- Seasonal peaks in earlier years have become less pronounced in recent data, suggesting changes in transmission dynamics or improved vaccination. <br/>
- Some data gaps, notably in early 2013, which could affect trend accuracy. <br/>

From January 2010 to November 2023, reported Hepatitis A cases in the Chinese mainland show a downward trend, decreasing from yearly highs around 3000 cases to less than 1100 cases towards the end of the period. There's a notable spike of 2235 cases in May 2012. Seasonal variations are apparent, with higher case counts seen generally in middle-year months. While data for January and February 2013 are missing, overall, a consistent decline in case numbers is evident over the years.

The number of deaths associated with Hepatitis A over the same period was low, with monthly figures mostly at one or fewer. An exceptional spike of 56 deaths in May 2012 is an outlier in the dataset. There's no clear seasonal pattern to the fatalities, and deaths do not appear to correlate strongly with case numbers. The data shows that for most months, the reported death toll was zero, suggesting that mortality due to Hepatitis A in the Chinese mainland during this period was rare.
