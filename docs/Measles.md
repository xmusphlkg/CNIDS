# Measles 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease causing fever, cough, runny nose, inflamed eyes, and a distinctive red rash. It spreads through respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes. Despite the development of effective vaccines, measles remains a significant cause of death in children worldwide, particularly in areas with low vaccination coverage. Complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare chronic inflammation of the brain. Global health efforts focus on vaccination as the primary prevention strategy.

## Highlights

1. There has been a significant decrease in measles cases in China over the past decade, with a high of 13318 cases in May 2010 to just 78 cases in September 2023. <br/>
2. The drop in measles cases corresponds with a reduction in related deaths, with the last recorded death occurring in December 2016. <br/>
3. There is a seasonal pattern, with the highest numbers of cases typically occurring in the first half of the year, peaking around April and May. <br/>
4. As of September 2023, measles appears to be well-controlled in mainland China with a steady state of low-number monthly cases and no recent fatalities.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported measles cases in mainland China present an overall decreasing trend from 2010 to 2023. The largest surge was in 2014, hitting a peak in May with 13,318 cases. Post-2014, there was a year-long decline until the cases rose again in 2015. From 2016 onwards, a consistent decrease in cases can be observed with occasional minor upswings. By 2020, the monthly cases had reduced to double digits, primarily below 200, and this trend continued up to 2023. 

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths linked to measles presents a generally sporadic pattern. However, the death count remained relatively low throughout the years, from 2010 to 2023, even during periods when the number of cases surged. The highest number of deaths was reported in May 2010 with 12 fatalities. Despite ups and downs in the following years, no deaths were reported post-2016. This suggests increasingly effective treatment and prevention measures over the years.
