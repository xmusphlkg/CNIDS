# Measles 

Version: November 2023 

## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease caused by the measles virus. It's transmitted through respiratory droplets and can survive in the air for up to two hours. Symptoms typically include high fever, cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes, followed by a distinctive red rash spreading over the body. Severe complications can occur, particularly in malnourished children and people with reduced immunity. Vaccination is the most effective prevention method, specifically the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Globally, measles remains a leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in children.

## Highlights

1. From 2010 to 2023, a general decline in measles cases has been observed in mainland China. Annual peaks, usually seen around spring, have also declined over time. <br/>
2. Despite fluctuations in the count of cases, measles-associated deaths have remained extremely low, often recording zero for most months. <br/>
3. Interestingly, the measles cases have been consistently low (below 200) each month since 2020, suggesting successful implementation of measles prevention strategies. <br/>
4. As of November 2023, the measles situation is well controlled with only 78 cases and no deaths reported in this month.

From 2010 to 2023, the annual measles incidence in mainland China showed a generally declining trend. Initially, cases peaked between April to June, hitting a remarkable high in May 2010 with 13,318 cases. This could be attributed to seasonal variation in measles transmission. Sharp decreases were observed, reaching their lowest in recent years in January 2023 with merely 18 cases. The significant decrease post-2014 could be due to improved vaccination rates and efforts to control the spread of the disease.

Although measles cases were high, the death toll in the given period remains relatively low, somewhat maintaining an inconsistent trend. Deaths peaked at 12 in May 2010, coinciding with the highest number of measles cases. Thereafter, the fatality rates experienced a gradual decrease, resulting in zero fatalities from January 2018 onwards. The low mortality rate could be attributed to better disease management, prompt case detection, isolation, and improved health care.
