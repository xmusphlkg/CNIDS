              <h3>Measles <br> 麻疹</h3>

            <br>
            Measles, also known as rubeola, is a contagious viral infection primarily affecting children. It is caused by the measles virus, a member of the Paramyxoviridae family. Measles spreads through respiratory droplets and typically presents with symptoms including fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes, and a distinctive rash. Despite being preventable through vaccination, measles continues to be a significant global public health concern.<br>Epidemiology:<br>Global Prevalence: Measles is found worldwide, but its prevalence varies geographically. Before widespread vaccination, measles was nearly universal in childhood. Since the introduction of the vaccine in the 1960s, significant progress has been made in reducing measles cases and deaths. However, measles remains endemic in many parts of the world, especially in developing countries with limited access to vaccination programs.<br>Transmission Routes: Measles primarily spreads through respiratory droplets. Infected individuals can transmit the virus to others through coughing, sneezing, or direct contact with nasal or throat secretions. The virus can survive in the air or on surfaces for up to two hours, making it highly contagious.<br>Affected Populations: Measles primarily affects children, particularly those who have not received the vaccine. However, individuals of any age, including adults, can contract measles if they have not been immunized or have not previously had the infection. Infants who are too young to receive the vaccine and individuals with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable.<br>Key Statistics: Prior to widespread vaccination, measles caused approximately 2-3 million deaths annually. However, thanks to global immunization efforts, this number has significantly decreased over the years. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated approximately 207,500 measles deaths worldwide, equivalent to approximately 567 deaths per day or 24 deaths per hour.<br>Historical Context and Discovery: Measles has been known for centuries. Ancient Chinese, Persian, and Arabian texts described the symptoms of measles as early as the 9th century. However, the first formal description of the disease was made by the Persian physician Rhazes in the 10th century. The virus responsible for measles was not discovered until 1954 by American physician Thomas Huckle Weller and colleagues.<br>Major Risk Factors:<br>1. Lack of Vaccination: The primary risk factor for contracting measles is the absence of vaccination. Unvaccinated individuals who come into contact with the virus are highly susceptible to infection.<br>2. Travel to Endemic Areas: Traveling to regions with active measles transmission increases the risk of contracting the disease. Unvaccinated individuals traveling to countries with low immunization rates or ongoing outbreaks are particularly vulnerable.<br>3. Lack of Healthcare Infrastructure: Limited access to healthcare services, particularly in developing countries, contributes to low immunization rates and increases the risk of measles outbreaks.<br>Impact on Regions and Populations:<br>Prevalence Rates: The prevalence of measles varies globally. Regions such as Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific have higher incidence rates compared to countries with robust vaccination programs. In contrast, regions like the Americas, Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean have achieved significant reductions in measles cases, primarily due to vaccination efforts.<br>Affected Demographics: Measles can affect individuals of any age and demographic; however, outbreaks often occur in populations with lower vaccine coverage. These include communities with vaccine hesitancy, marginalized populations, and areas with weak healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, overcrowded settings such as refugee camps and schools can facilitate rapid measles transmission.<br>In conclusion, measles is a highly contagious viral infection that remains a significant global public health concern. Although vaccination has dramatically reduced measles cases and deaths, outbreaks still occur, particularly in regions with limited access to immunization programs. Lack of vaccination, travel to endemic areas, and limited healthcare infrastructure are the primary risk factors for measles transmission. Efforts to increase vaccination coverage and strengthen healthcare systems are essential to further control and prevent the spread of measles.

              <h3>Measles <br> 麻疹</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the available data, there is a clear seasonal pattern in the incidence of measles cases in mainland China. Measles cases are most prevalent during the spring and summer months (March to August) and least common during the winter months (December to February). This recurring seasonal trend is consistent across multiple years.<br>Peak and Trough Periods: 
The highest number of measles cases in mainland China occur during the months of May and June, representing the peak period. Conversely, the lowest number of cases, or trough period, is observed in December and January.<br>Overall Trends: 
There has been a gradual decrease in the number of measles cases in mainland China over the years. From 2010 to 2013, a downward trend was evident. However, there was a notable increase in cases from 2013 to 2015, followed by another decrease from 2015 to 2018. Since 2018, the number of cases has remained relatively low and stable.<br>Discussion:
The observed seasonal pattern of measles cases in mainland China aligns with the known transmission dynamics of the disease. Measles is highly contagious and spreads easily in densely populated areas, which are more common during warmer months when people spend more time outdoors and in close proximity to one another.<br>Various factors contribute to the peak period in May and June, including increased travel and social gatherings during holidays and school breaks. These factors may facilitate the transmission of the virus among susceptible individuals. Conversely, reduced social interactions and heightened awareness of preventive measures during the winter season likely contribute to the trough period in December and January.<br>The overall decline in measles cases over the years can be attributed to successful vaccination campaigns and improved public health measures in mainland China. Implementation of measles vaccination programs has resulted in increased immunity and reduced transmission of the virus. However, it is crucial to maintain high vaccination coverage and continue monitoring the situation to prevent future outbreaks.<br>It is important to note that the provided data relates solely to measles cases and deaths. To gain a comprehensive understanding of measles epidemiology in mainland China, additional information such as vaccination coverage, age distribution of cases, and geographic variations would be invaluable.
