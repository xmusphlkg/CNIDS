              <h3>Poliomyelitis <br> 脊髓灰质炎</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            Poliomyelitis, commonly referred to as polio, is an infectious viral disease caused by the poliovirus. It primarily affects children under the age of five, but it can also impact older children and adults. The disease has been a notable public health concern globally, resulting in paralysis and even death in severe cases. However, thanks to extensive vaccination efforts, the prevalence of poliomyelitis has significantly decreased over the past few decades.<br>Historical Context and Discovery:
Poliomyelitis has been documented throughout history, with evidence dating back to Ancient Egypt. However, it was not recognized as a distinct illness until the late 19th century. In 1908, Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper successfully isolated a virus from patients with poliomyelitis, confirming that the disease had a viral cause. Further research in the mid-20th century led to the development of effective vaccines by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, which greatly contributed to the efforts aimed at controlling and eradicating polio.<br>Global Prevalence:
Poliomyelitis was once endemic in many parts of the world, resulting in large-scale outbreaks and epidemics. Nonetheless, successful vaccination programs have led to a drastic reduction in the number of polio cases. As of 2021, only two countries, Afghanistan and Pakistan, still have endemic wild poliovirus transmission. The overall global prevalence has decreased by over 99% since the establishment of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988.<br>Transmission Routes:
The poliovirus is primarily transmitted through the fecal-oral route, typically via contaminated food, water, or direct contact with an infected person's feces or respiratory droplets. The virus replicates in the intestines and can spread to the nervous system, resulting in paralysis in some cases. The poliovirus is highly contagious and can spread rapidly, particularly in areas with inadequate sanitation and low vaccination coverage.<br>Affected Populations:
Poliomyelitis can affect individuals of all age groups, but young children are the most vulnerable. In regions with high transmission rates, infants are typically affected due to limited immunity resulting from previous exposure or vaccination. People with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or malnutrition, are also at a heightened risk of contracting polio and experiencing severe complications.<br>Key Statistics:
- In 2020, there were only 122 reported cases of wild poliovirus worldwide, primarily in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
- The global prevalence of paralytic polio cases decreased from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to fewer than 100 cases in 2019.
- The successful eradication of wild poliovirus type 2 was achieved in 2015, with no reported cases since then.
- The vast majority of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic, with only a small proportion resulting in paralysis or other severe symptoms.<br>Major Risk Factors:
- Inadequate vaccination coverage: Lack of immunization or incomplete vaccine coverage increases the risk of polio transmission.
- Poor sanitation and hygiene: Contaminated water sources, inadequate waste disposal, and unsanitary living conditions facilitate the transmission of the poliovirus.
- Travel and migration: The movement of infected individuals from endemic areas to non-endemic regions can introduce the virus to susceptible populations.
- Conflict and instability: Polio eradication efforts are often impeded in regions experiencing armed conflict, political instability, or weak health infrastructure.<br>Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of polio varies across regions, with the highest prevalence observed in countries where the virus is endemic. Regions with low socioeconomic development, limited access to healthcare, and political unrest face the greatest challenges in controlling the spread of polio. Disparities in vaccine coverage can also contribute to variations in prevalence rates and affected populations. Additionally, certain marginalized populations, such as refugees and internally displaced individuals, may face increased vulnerability due to limited access to healthcare and vaccination services.<br>In conclusion, poliomyelitis has significantly declined in global prevalence due to comprehensive vaccination efforts. However, it is crucial to maintain continued surveillance, vaccination campaigns, and awareness programs to achieve the eradication of polio worldwide. The disease remains a concern in specific regions with inadequate health infrastructure and ongoing conflicts. Addressing risk factors, ensuring high vaccination coverage, and maintaining strong surveillance systems are essential in preventing the transmission of polio and protecting vulnerable populations.

            Seasonal Patterns: The analysis of the provided data on Poliomyelitis cases and deaths in mainland China reveals no discernible seasonal pattern.
