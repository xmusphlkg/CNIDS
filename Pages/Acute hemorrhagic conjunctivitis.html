              <h3>Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis <br> 急性出血性结膜炎</h3>
            </div>
            <br>
            Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly contagious viral infection characterized by the sudden onset of redness, swelling, and discharge in the conjunctiva of the eye. It is caused by several types of viruses, primarily Enterovirus 70 (EV70) and Coxsackievirus A24 (CA24).<br>Historical Context and Discovery:
The first description of AHC was in 1969 during an outbreak in Ghana, Africa. It later spread to other parts of Africa and then to Asia. The pandemic nature of AHC was recognized in the 1970s when it rapidly circulated in various regions worldwide. Since then, AHC outbreaks have been reported in many countries, with varying levels of severity.<br>Prevalence:
AHC is prevalent globally, but its impact varies among different regions and populations. Outbreaks have been reported in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Americas, and Oceania. The incidence of AHC is typically higher in tropical and subtropical regions due to favorable environmental conditions for viral transmission.<br>Transmission Routes:
AHC is primarily transmitted through direct contact with infected ocular secretions or contaminated surfaces. The virus can be present in tears, nasal secretions, and feces of infected individuals. Transmission can occur through hand-to-eye contact, sharing contaminated objects such as towels or eye drops, and exposure to respiratory droplets generated by infected individuals through coughing or sneezing.<br>Affected Populations:
AHC can affect individuals of all ages and demographics. However, certain populations are more susceptible to infection. Young children, especially those attending daycare facilities or schools, are at a higher risk due to close contact. Additionally, individuals with poor hygiene practices, such as inadequate handwashing, are more vulnerable to AHC.<br>Key Statistics:
Exact global statistics for AHC are challenging to determine, as many cases go unreported or are misdiagnosed. However, outbreaks have been reported intermittently in many countries. During outbreaks, AHC can affect a significant number of individuals within a short period. In densely populated areas, the spread of AHC can be rapid, leading to substantial morbidity.<br>Risk Factors:
Several risk factors contribute to the transmission of AHC. These include overcrowded living conditions, poor sanitation, lack of access to clean water, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, behaviors such as close contact with infected individuals, lack of hand hygiene, and sharing personal items increase the risk of AHC transmission.<br>Impact on Regions and Populations:
The impact of AHC varies geographically. In some regions, AHC may occur sporadically or as localized outbreaks, primarily affecting specific communities or institutions. However, in other regions, widespread outbreaks can occur, resulting in significant morbidity and strain on healthcare systems.<br>In developing countries with limited resources and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, AHC outbreaks can have a severe impact. They can impose a considerable burden on healthcare facilities that are already managing other infectious diseases. Additionally, productivity loss due to illness or caring for affected individuals can have economic consequences for affected populations.<br>Variations in prevalence rates and affected demographics can be observed within regions. Factors such as population density, healthcare access, and socio-economic conditions contribute to these variations. Targeted public health interventions and improved hygiene practices can help mitigate the impact of AHC and reduce transmission rates.<br>Overall, AHC remains a significant public health concern, particularly in regions with lower socio-economic status and limited resources. Continued surveillance, early detection, and timely implementation of control measures are necessary to minimize the spread and impact of this viral infection.

            <br>
            Seasonal Patterns:<br>Based on the provided data, a clear seasonal pattern for cases of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) in mainland China is evident. The number of cases tends to be highest during the summer months (June, July, and August) and lowest during the winter months (December, January, and February). This suggests a greater prevalence of AHC during warmer months.<br>Peak and Trough Periods:<br>The peak period for AHC cases in mainland China occurs in September, with a particularly high number of cases reported in September 2023 (125,264 cases). This indicates a significant outbreak during that month. Conversely, the trough period is observed during the winter months, with the lowest number of cases reported in December, January, and February.<br>Overall Trends:<br>Overall, there is an increasing trend in the number of AHC cases in mainland China from 2010 to 2023. The number of cases gradually rises from approximately 600 in 2010 to a peak of 125,264 in September 2023. However, it is important to acknowledge that there is significant variation in case numbers from year to year, with some years experiencing higher case counts than others.<br>Discussion:<br>The observed seasonal pattern in the data suggests that AHC is influenced by environmental factors that are more prevalent during the summer months. These factors may include higher temperatures, increased humidity, or increased exposure to the causative agent of AHC. The peak in September 2023 indicates a particularly severe outbreak, which may have been influenced by specific factors such as changes in the circulating strain of the virus or increased transmission within the population.<br>The overall increasing trend in the number of AHC cases over the years could be attributed to various factors, including improved surveillance and reporting systems, increased awareness and diagnosis of AHC, changes in population density and mobility, and changes in the prevalence of risk factors such as poor hygiene practices or overcrowding.<br>It is important to note that the analysis is based solely on the provided data. Additional information, such as population size, demographic characteristics, and specific geographical locations, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology of AHC in mainland China.
