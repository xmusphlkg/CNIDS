# Hepatitis C 

Version: September 2023 

## Introduction

Hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). It results in inflammation and can lead to serious liver damage. The virus is typically spread through blood-to-blood contact, often via sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. Many people with HCV are asymptomatic, but when present, symptoms may include fatigue, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Chronic Hepatitis C can result in long-term health issues such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Antiviral medications can treat and cure most cases of Hepatitis C infection.

## Highlights

2. An alarming spike in death rates is evident from July 2022, surpassing previous records and consistently increasing, with the peak in June 2023 at 186 deaths.<br/>

3. Despite an increase in cases in 2023, September reports a slight decrease in both reported cases and deaths compared to the previous month.<br/>

4. Overall, the Hepatitis C situation in mainland China is deteriorating, with a marked increase in mortality in the most recent year. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The number of Hepatitis C cases in mainland China has displayed an inconsistent trend, with some fluctuations. From 2010 to 2022, there was a general increase, with the highest number of cases (24,666) recorded in March 2018. However, a sharp decrease in the number of cases has been observed from 2022, dropping to 11,050 in December 2022. This is followed by a sudden increase in cases in January 2023 to 20,580. 

### Deaths Analysis
In terms of fatalities, the death toll has remained relatively low throughout the years 2010-2022, seeing negligible changes with a few notable spikes such as 21 deaths in March 2017. However, from 2023, there's a significant surge in Hepatitis C-related deaths, exponentially rising from 13 in January to 186 in June, averaging 109.75 cases for the first eight months of 2023. This sudden upsurge necessitates an immediate public health response for disease control.
