Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2024 April.

Given the vast amount of data provided, it is not feasible to analyze every detail within this format. However, I will highlight some of the key observations from the April 2024 data for selected notable diseases. Please note that since the original data spans various months and diseases, the focus here will be more general, summarizing trends or interesting findings for April 2024. The numbers in parentheses next to the cases represent deaths.

**1. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** 5,295 cases were reported with 1,857 deaths. This significant number of cases and the high mortality rate underscore the continued challenge AIDS presents to public health in China.

**2. Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis:** There was a substantial outbreak with 23,111 cases reported, but fortunately, there were no deaths. This indicates a highly contagious disease with relatively low mortality.

**3. Anthrax:** Reported cases stood at 20, with no deaths. Though the number of cases is small, the presence of this disease highlights the need for vigilance in monitoring and controlling zoonotic diseases.

**4. Brucellosis:** A total of 6,197 cases were reported with no deaths. This suggests effective treatment and management of the disease, despite its relatively high incidence.

**5. Dengue:** There were 38 cases and no deaths. This relatively low number might reflect effective mosquito control and public health measures.

**6. Dysentery:** Reported cases were 2,087 with no deaths, indicating good control and treatment of this potentially deadly disease.

**7. Echinococcosis:** With 534 cases reported and no deaths, it shows the continued presence of this parasitic disease, which requires ongoing attention from health authorities.

**8. Hepatitis (All Types):** Hepatitis continues to be a significant public health concern, with cases of Hepatitis A (1,542; 2 deaths), Hepatitis B (152,967; 24 deaths), Hepatitis C (22,215; 133 deaths), Hepatitis D (19 cases), and Hepatitis E (3,676 cases) reported. This highlights the diverse nature of viral hepatitis and the considerable health resources needed to manage these diseases.

**9. Human Infection with H7N9 Virus:** One case was reported with zero deaths, an important reminder of the potential for zoonotic transmission of influenza viruses from animals to humans.

**10. Infectious Diarrhea:** A significantly high number of 196,347 cases were reported with only one death, suggesting a widespread but generally not fatal disease, likely due to effective hydration and treatment protocols.

**11. Influenza:** Reported cases were 856,355 with only 3 deaths, reflecting either widespread seasonal activity with relatively low mortality or possibly a reporting anomaly or data issue, given the large case number with very few deaths.

**12. Tuberculosis (TB):** TB remains a major public health issue with 64,161 cases and 7 deaths reported. The data underscores the ongoing challenge TB poses and the need for sustained efforts in TB control and prevention.

These highlights draw attention to the continuing challenges posed by infectious diseases in China, the effectiveness of public health measures in managing some of these diseases, and the importance of surveillance, prevention, and treatment programs.
