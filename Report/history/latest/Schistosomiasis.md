## Introduction

Schistosomiasis, also termed "snail fever," is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms of the Schistosoma species. Transmitted to humans through water contaminated with larvae, these parasites invade the circulatory system, potentially leading to liver, kidney, and bladder damage or, in severe cases, death. With effective treatment available, this aility primarily plagues impoverished communities lacking clean water and sanitation. The World Health Organization estimates 200 million people are infected, primarily in Africa, making it the second most common parasitic disease after malaria.
## Highlights

1. Significant Decrease in Cases: From 2010-2023, there has been a considerable reduction in Schistosomiasis cases, peaking in 2015 with 10481 cases in November then decreasing to just 3 cases by November 2023.<br/>
2. Mortality rate remains minimal: Throughout the covered period, there was a relatively low mortality rate, with only a few reported deaths.<br/>
3. Seasonal Trend: There's a tendency for cases to spike mid-year (June and July) and near the end of each year (October and November), indicating potential seasonality.<br/>
4. Increased Efforts in Disease Control: The drastic reduction suggests the implementation of effective disease control strategies post-2015.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data suggests a declining trend in schistosomiasis cases in mainland China over the past decade. Particularly notable is the dramatic decrease from 2015 onwards, the year with the highest reported cases (10481 in November), leading to much lower averages in subsequent years. Despite occasional spikes, predominantly observed in autumn months, data in later years show an average monthly figure often below 20. Overall, this indicates a significant improvement in the control of schistosomiasis, possibly due to enhanced disease surveillance, increased public awareness, and preventative health measures.

### Deaths Analysis
The death reports are reassuringly low throughout the years with only seven recorded fatalities from 2011 to 2023. There are two registered deaths in 2011 and one each in 2012, 2013, 2016, 2020, and none recorded in other years. This data suggests a successful medical intervention and effective case management of schistosomiasis. The low death rate might be attributed to a combination of improved medical treatment, swift diagnosis, and a robust public health infrastructure capable of containing the disease's severity.
