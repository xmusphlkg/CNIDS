## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are bacterial infections caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, respectively. These illnesses are typically spread through contaminated food or water and can lead to high fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. Infection can result in severe complications or death if not treated promptly, generally with antibiotics. Typhoid is more prevalent in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. Vaccines are available for prevention, but they are not fully protective and therefore, maintaining good hygiene practices remains crucial.

## Highlights

1. There has been a notable decline in the number of reported Typhoid and paratyphoid fever cases in mainland China between 2010 and 2023.<br/>
2. The peak of cases generally appears in the mid-year, specifically around June to August, followed by a gradual decrease towards the end of the year.<br/>
3. The death rate due to Typhoid and paratyphoid fever remains low, indicating effective medical response, with occasional spike reported in some months.<br/>
4. As of September 2023, the situation is under control with a reported 596 cases and no deaths, maintaining the downward trend.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
China's data on typhoid and paratyphoid fever from 2010 to 2023 shows seasonal fluctuations yearly, with an overall trend of gradual decline. The peak numbers are usually recorded in the summer months between June and August, an indicator of the influence of climatic conditions on transmission. Over the years, numbers have been decreasing, suggesting improved public health interventions and improved water and sanitation infrastructure. The year 2010 had the highest count overall, with August recording 1867 cases, while 2023 records significantly fewer cases, with the highest being 678 in August.

### Deaths Analysis
In contrast to the case data, death counts remain remarkably low throughout the observation period, indicating a high survival rate. Despite the seasonal fluctuations of caseload, no apparent pattern is noted in the death data. In total, 23 deaths are recorded between 2010 and 2023. The highest count was in 2017 with 4 deaths despite the number of cases not being the highest, suggesting variance in disease severity or treatment efficacy. Zero deaths are frequently observed, pointing to the success of treatment and disease control measures.
