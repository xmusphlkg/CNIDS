## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum. Initial symptoms include small, painless sores or a rash, often unnoticed due to their locations. As the disease progresses, it can cause complications like organ damage or neurological issues. It's often divided into stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary, each with different symptoms. Early stages are highly contagious, but it is curable with prompt antibiotic treatment. Transmission primarily occurs through sexual contact, but can also be passed from mother to child during pregnancy.

## Highlights

- Syphilis cases in Chinese mainland have been rising overall from 2010 to 2023, with fluctuations. The case count reached its peak in November 2023 with a record 57,719 new cases. <br/>
- Despite the increase in cases, the death count has remained relatively low and steady, ranging from 0 to 25 per month over the 13-year period. This could be the result of improved disease management and treatment. <br/>
- Cases appear to peak annually during the summer months of June-August, suggesting seasonality in syphilis transmission. <br/>
- Comparing the start and end data points (January 2010 to November 2023), there is more than a double increase in the case count, signifying a high disease burden.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The available data for Syphilis cases in Chinese mainland suggests an overall upward trend, with a peak in August 2023 at 61,068 cases. The lowest recorded cases occurred in February 2010 and December 2022 at 19,724 and 24,367 cases respectively. A pattern emerges, where an escalation in cases typically begins in February, reaching its peak around mid-year, and then declines towards the year-end. However, the data also shows occasional fluctuations, indicating potential variations due to certain environmental or behavioral factors.

### Deaths Analysis

With respect to death rate, the data depicts a relatively low mortality rate over the years, with a maximum of 25 deaths in January 2020. The lowest recorded value was none in May 2022. There doesn't seem to be a clear pattern or seasonality in the death counts. This could signify effective treatment measures or possibly underreporting of mortality figures. The peak value in 2020 could point towards possible stressors like the COVID-19 pandemic impacting existing healthcare services. Overall, the consistently low death count suggests a successful management of severe cases in Chinese mainland.
