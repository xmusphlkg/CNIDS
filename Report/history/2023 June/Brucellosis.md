Seasonal Patterns:
According to the data, Brucellosis cases in Chinese mainland demonstrate a clear seasonal pattern. The highest number of cases is observed during the summer months from June to August, with a peak in June. There is a gradual increase in cases from February to June, followed by a subsequent decrease from July to September. From October to January, the number of cases remains relatively low.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for Brucellosis cases in Chinese mainland occurs in June, with the highest recorded cases during this month. Conversely, the trough period is in September, when the number of cases is significantly lower compared to the peak months.

Overall Trends:
Overall, there has been a fluctuating trend in Brucellosis cases in Chinese mainland. From 2010 to 2012, cases gradually increased, followed by a decrease from 2013 to 2014. However, starting from 2015, there has been a rising trend in cases, with occasional fluctuations, particularly in 2018 and 2019. The highest number of cases was recorded in June 2023, reaching 8326 cases.

Discussion:
The observed seasonal patterns and peak and trough periods in Brucellosis cases in Chinese mainland suggest the presence of influencing factors in the transmission and spread of the disease. The higher number of cases during the summer months may be attributed to increased contact with livestock during farming activities. Since Brucellosis is primarily a zoonotic disease transmitted from animals to humans, the peak in cases during the summer months could indicate increased exposure to infected animals at that time.

The overall trend of Brucellosis cases in Chinese mainland reveals a fluctuating pattern, with some years experiencing higher case numbers compared to others. This could be due to various factors, such as changes in surveillance and reporting systems, variations in livestock farming practices, and public health interventions. Further analysis and investigation are necessary to identify specific factors influencing these trends and to implement effective control and prevention measures.

It is important to note that the provided data only includes reported cases of Brucellosis and deaths in Chinese mainland. A more comprehensive analysis would require additional data on population demographics, geographical distribution, and specific risk factors associated with Brucellosis transmission.
