## Introduction

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus. It is usually transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water, or direct contact with an infected person. Symptoms may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark urine, and yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice). While the disease can be serious, most people recover fully with no permanent liver damage. Vaccination is available and effective in preventing Hepatitis A.

## Highlights

1. Long-term downward trend: Over the years, the number of Hepatitis A cases has shown a steady decrease from nearly 4000 cases per month in 2010 to around 1000 cases in 2023. This indicates successful preventive and control measures in place.<br/>
2. Low mortality rate: Despite fluctuations in case numbers, the mortality rate remained low, generally limited to single-digit numbers each month, highlighting improved treatment regimens.<br/>
3. Seasonal peaks: Observing the data, it shows a certain seasonal pattern, with the number of cases often peaking around the middle of the year (May to August).<br/>
4. Current status: As of November 2023, the situation is under control with a total of 1056 cases reported, and no deaths, indicating a continuation of the long-term trend.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis 
The Hepatitis A cases data from 2010 through 2023 discloses an overall decreasing trend in Mainland China. High numbers were observed in mid-2010 with a peak at 3789 cases in August. Thereafter, a gradual decline over the years is evident, with some seasonal surges usually in spring and summer months. Nevertheless, these surges have reduced in magnitude over the years, and by 2023, the highest monthly reported cases dropped to 1289 in March.

### Deaths Analysis
The death rate for Hepatitis A in the given period is significantly low, showcasing the non-lethal nature of the virus. A major aberration appears in May 2012, with 56 deaths reported, an anomaly in the general trend. Typically, monthly fatalities oscillate between 0 to 2. It's vital to investigate the sudden spike in 2012 for any systemic healthcare failures. Interestingly, no substantial correlation seems to exist between the number of reported cases and resultant deaths over these years.
