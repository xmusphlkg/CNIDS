## Introduction

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a severe viral infection transmitted predominantly by the Culex mosquito species. It primarily affects the central nervous system, causing inflammation in the brain. It's considered a significant public health problem in Asia and the Western Pacific, often leading to fatal outcomes or permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae. The virus is maintained in a cycle involving mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts, typically pigs and wading birds. Despite not all infected humans developing symptoms, the case-fatality rate can be as high as 30% among those with symptomatic JE.

## Highlights

- The data demonstrates a clear seasonal trend for Japanese encephalitis in China, with cases peaking in summer and early autumn months each year.<br/>
- There is a notable decrease in both the number of cases and deaths from 2014 to 2024, with zero reported cases or deaths in March 2024.<br/>
- Despite fluctuating case numbers, the mortality rate shows an overall decline, reflecting advancements in disease management and treatment.<br/>
- As of March 2024, Japanese encephalitis doesn't present a significant public health issue in mainland China.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between 2014 to 2024, Japanese encephalitis cases in mainland China hit their peak during the summer months, between June and September. This is potentially due to the enhanced breeding of the mosquitos, which are known carriers of the disease. Apart from the months, the data over the years shows fluctuations in the number of cases with the peak of 904 reported in August 2018. The trend seems to be descending from 2014 to 2024, suggesting possible effective interventions during this period. However, the case load is still significant, implying persisting challenges in control efforts.

### Deaths Analysis
The data from 2014 to 2024 show average death counts due to Japanese encephalitis ranged between 1-15 per month, with the highest at 55 in August 2018. The mortality maintained a relatively more constant trend across these years as compared to the cases. Most deaths, like the cases, were reported in summer, which again, could be linked to the peak mosquito activity. The death count in April 2019 is an outlier with 26 deaths, far from the range in other months, which might indicate an outbreak situation. Effective interventions need to be further strengthened to lower the mortality rates.
