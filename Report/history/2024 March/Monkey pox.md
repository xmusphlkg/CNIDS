## Introduction

Monkeypox is a rare viral zoonotic disease that occurs primarily in remote parts of Central and West Africa. It is commonly associated with rodents and monkeys, hence the name. The virus, part of the Orthopoxvirus genus, is similar to human smallpox. Individuals infected with monkeypox may exhibit fever, headache, muscle aches, and rash. The disease is usually a self-limiting condition, meaning it typically goes away on its own after a few weeks. However, serious complications, including death, can occur, especially in those with weakened immune systems.

## Highlights

- Disease Trend: A general declining trend in Monkey pox cases can be observed since October 2023 in Chinese mainland, with a slight increase in December 2023. <br/>
- Recent Statistics: As of March 2024, there have been 51 reported cases- the lowest since September 2023. <br/>
- Mortality: Remarkably, despite fluctuations in case numbers, the fatality rate has consistently remained at zero across these months. <br/>
- Current Status: In summary, despite an initial surge in cases in late 2023, Monkey pox has been generally decreasing in 2024 and has not caused any reported deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
In Chinese mainland, Monkeypox cases demonstrated a significant fluctuation from September 2023 to March 2024. In September 2023, 80 cases were reported, increasing by 59% the following month to 127 cases. However, November saw a return to September's count at 80 cases. This was trailed by a slight increase to 102 by December. Commencing from the peak in October 2023, a steady decline is observed in the succeeding five months, bottoming to 51 cases in March 2024. Despite fluctuations, an overall decreasing trend can be inferred considering this period. (Word Count: 100)

### Deaths Analysis
Interestingly, despite the variability of Monkeypox cases over the seven-month period, there were no reported deaths in the Chinese mainland. This could imply effective medical intervention and patient care preventing the disease's mortality. It could also suggest that the Monkeypox strains in circulation may be less virulent. However, further epidemiological analysis is needed to establish the reasons behind the zero-mortality rate. They could also include efficient case detection and reporting mechanisms or high patient resilience due to previous virus exposures or vaccinations. (Word Count: 104)
