## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea is a severe health concern primarily caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites that enter the body through consumption of contaminated food or water. The condition characteristically leads to frequent and watery bowel movements, abdominal cramps, fever, or vomiting. Determined through laboratory testing of stool samples, infectious diarrhea can affect any age group globally, but the impact is more severe, often fatal, on children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Preventive measures encompass proper hygiene, safe cooking practices, and clean water supply. Treatment usually involves rehydration and, in certain cases, antibiotics.

## Highlights

- Infectious diarrhea cases in Chinese mainland show an increasing trend over the past decade, with a peak in March 2024 (196,347 cases). <br/>
- Case numbers typically rise during summer months (June, July, August) possibly due to environmental factors. <br/>
- The number of deaths remains low and relatively constant indicating successful disease management.<br/>
- While cases usually decline towards year-end, recent data, especially 2024, suggests a shift in this pattern.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Infectious diarrhea reports in the Chinese mainland showcase a consistent seasonal trend from 2014 to 2024. Incidence generally increases from March, peaking in July or August each year, followed by a gradual decline until February of the following year. This pattern is likely associated with warm and wet weather conditions in summer, favoring the transmission of enteric pathogens. Another notable observation is an overall increase in reported cases over this decade-long period, with cases almost quadrupling from 43,524 in March 2014 to a record high of 196,347 in March 2024. This surge might reflect growing population, enhanced surveillance, or evolving pathogen transmission dynamics.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the substantial increase in the number of cases, the mortality associated with infectious diarrhea remained remarkably low and infrequent throughout this period, with maximum recorded deaths per month being 7 in July 2014. No consistent pattern or trend in deaths is apparent from the available data. This low mortality may be indicative of effective health infrastructure and medical care, considering that high incidence of infectious diarrhea often results in significant mortality in resource-poor settings. Furthermore, continued low mortality over time despite a dramatic increase in cases could also be indicative of improvements in clinical management protocols, patient education, and preventive measures.
