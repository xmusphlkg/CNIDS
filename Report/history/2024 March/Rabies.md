## Introduction

Rabies is a deadly viral disease primarily transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal. It affects the central nervous system, eventually leading to disease in the brain and death. Symptoms include fever, headache, excess salivation, muscle spasms, paralysis, and mental confusion. Although rabies is a preventable disease through the administration of a post-exposure prophylaxis, it remains a major public health concern globally, particularly in Asia and Africa, with more than 59,000 people dying of the disease annually.

## Highlights

- The incidence and death rates from Rabies on the Chinese mainland have shown a generally declining trend from 2014 to 2024. <br/>
- There was a significant drop in cases and deaths since 2017, with numbers from 2014-2016 averaging in the 50s-70s per month, falling to single digits to teens per month by 2024. <br/>
- Despite this overall decreasing trend, there have been periodic increases in incidence and mortality, particularly observed during the mid-year and end-year periods. <br/>
- However, the situation as of March 2024 indicates stable control over the disease with only 6 cases and 6 deaths reported.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data for Rabies cases in China from March 2014 to March 2024 shows certain fluctuations, with a general downward trend over the years. The highest number of cases recorded in a single month is 105 in September 2014. This number decreases notably in subsequent years, with spikes around mid-year, possibly due to increased outdoor activities in warmer months resulting in more human-animal interactions. By 2024, the figures consistently reside below 20 each month, indicating positive progress in Rabies control and prevention. The overall decrease suggests improved public health awareness, better sanitation, and successful vaccination programs. 

### Deaths Analysis
Just like the cases, Rabies-related deaths also portray a declining trend over this decade. The highest recorded deaths occurred in January 2015 with 95 fatalities. The death counts typically correlate with the number of reported cases, indicating a high fatality nature of the disease. However, this correlation seems lesser in later years, potentially due to enhanced treatment availability and response. The figures for Rabies deaths in recent years have mostly stayed under 20 a month, signifying containment efforts' effectiveness. Variation in numbers can be attributed to variable professional healthcare access and vaccination rates.
