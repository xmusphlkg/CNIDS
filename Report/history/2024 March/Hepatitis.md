## Introduction

Hepatitis refers to an inflammatory condition of the liver, primarily caused by viral infections but may also result from toxins, drugs, alcohol, or certain non-viral infections. There are five main types of viral hepatitis: A, B, C, D, and E, each caused by a different virus. The most concerning are Hepatitis B and C, leading to chronic diseases in hundreds of millions of people and, together, responsible for most of the liver cancer cases worldwide. Vaccinations are available for Hepatitis A and B while treatments for Hepatitis C can cure most cases.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, the reported data shows steady oscillation of Hepatitis cases throughout the year, with apparent peaks every March and July, and troughs around February and October. There appears to be a slow upward trend across the years, indicating an increasing number of reported cases over time despite seasonal fluctuations. Overall, the data suggests that the Hepatitis situation may be gradually worsening through this period. Notably, the data shows a significant drop in the number of cases in February 2020 and a considerable increase in the period between 2022 to 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths due to Hepatitis remained relatively low and stable from 2014 to 2019 but started to increase in early 2020, with peaks noted in January and September of the same year. From 2023 onwards, a sharp upward trend in fatalities became apparent, reaching an alarming figure in December 2023. Despite the downtrend in early 2024, the number of deaths remains significantly higher compared to the previous years. This data suggests a growing severity in the outcomes of Hepatitis infection during this period, which warrants an intensified approach for prevention and control.
