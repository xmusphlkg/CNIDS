## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals caused by the Leptospira bacteria. This bacteria is found globally but is most common in tropical climates. Infection can occur through direct contact with urine from an infected animal or through water, soil, or food contaminated with their urine. Symptoms may range from none to mild (such as headaches, muscle pains, and fevers) to severe (like bleeding in the lungs or meningitis). Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, implying cross-infection between humans and animals is possible. It can result in kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, and even death if left untreated.

## Highlights

- Cases of Leptospirosis in mainland China tend to peak in the later part of the year, specifically around September and October. <br/>
- Despite occasional surges, the death toll remains low implying effective case management. <br/>
- There's a noticeable yearly decline in cases from 2014 to 2024, indicating successful preventive strategies. <br/>
- In March 2024, the situation is well controlled with minimal reported cases and zero deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Over ten years, from 2014 to 2024, mainland China experienced spikes in Leptospirosis cases typically around August and September each year, possibly linked to seasonal conditions. A high of 207 cases observed in December 2014 unusually deviated from this trend. The number of cases appeared to decrease overall throughout the years, with a notable dip in cases from 2016 to 2018. However, cases started increasing again from 2019 onwards, reaching nearly similar values to those of 2015 by 2020 and continuing the increasing trend thereafter, albeit not reaching the highs of 2014.

### Deaths Analysis

Deaths due to Leptospirosis were relatively low and infrequent, with no deaths in some years. A surge in deaths was seen in September and October of 2020, totaling 7, the highest in a two-month period over the observed decade. The years 2019 to 2021 displayed a slightly higher frequency of deaths as compared to earlier years, possibly indicating increased severity or changes in treatment efficacy. However, it is imperative to note that despite the increase in cases from 2019 onwards, the fatality remained relatively steady, indicating effective clinical management of reported cases.
