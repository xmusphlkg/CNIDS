## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as "Delta hepatitis", is a serious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis D virus (HDV). This virus is unique and can only infect individuals who are already infected with Hepatitis B virus, making it a co-infection or a superinfection. It can lead to acute or chronic disease, increasing the severity of Hepatitis B symptoms. The transmission methods include percutaneous or mucosal contact with infectious blood, often through shared needles or unprotected sex. There is currently no specific antiviral therapy for Hepatitis D.

## Highlights

- There has been a notable decline in Hepatitis D cases in China since 2016, indicating effective disease control measures.<br/>
- Since 2020, the number of reported cases annually has noticeably dropped to under 30 monthly instances, with the occasional exception.<br/>
- There have been no Hepatitis D-related deaths, highlighting successful medical intervention.<br/>
- Despite the encouraging trend, the persistence of new cases monthly suggests continuous disease transmission, underscoring the need for sustained vigilance and prevention efforts.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Hepatitis D testing data from Chinese mainland from January 2016 to March 2024 shows a general decline in reported cases. The year 2016 starts with 60 cases in January and ends with 33 cases in December. A similar pattern is seen in subsequent years with a peak usually around May each year. The highest numbers were recorded in 2017 with 59 cases in May and September. Notably, there's a substantial reduction in cases post-2020, with numbers often in the teens or low twenties, indicating a substantial improvement in Hepatitis D control over the years.

### Deaths Analysis 
In the provided data from January 2016 to March 2024, no deaths were reported due to Hepatitis D in the Chinese mainland. This could be attributed to early detection and effective treatment strategies employed, alongside enhanced viral hepatitis surveillance and response systems. Since Hepatitis D is a co-infection mainly occurring with Hepatitis B, effective Hepatitis B vaccination and treatment interventions might have also played a role. However, zero death reports should be interpreted with caution as underreporting due to misclassification or unrecognized cases may occur.
