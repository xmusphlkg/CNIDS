## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, primarily affecting children. It is transmitted through droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots in the mouth. A rash then develops, spreading from the face to the whole body. Complications can include blindness, encephalitis, pneumonia, and death. Despite availability of a safe and cost-effective vaccine, it remains a significant cause of mortality globally, particularly in developing regions.

## Highlights

- Significant decline in Measles cases in the Chinese mainland from 7864 in March 2014 to 66 in March 2024.<br/>
- Deaths are extremely low compared to cases, with a peak of 7 in April 2015 and zero deaths from 2020 onwards.<br/>
- Data indicates a seasonal trend with higher case counts in the first half of the year.<br/>
- Overall, the data suggests a successful reduction in Measles prevalence and mortality in the Chinese mainland over a decade.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The number of measles cases in China shows a consistent downward trend from 2014 to 2024. The most prominent decrease occurs from 2014 to 2015, where cases peak at 11,089 in April 2014 and drop significantly to a trough of 571 in October 2015. It's noticeable that each year follows a similar seasonal pattern with an increase that rises to a peak around Spring and then sharply declines towards the end of the year. From 2016 onwards, the general pattern maintains, but the number of cases continued to decline, reaching the lowest number of 31 by February 2024.

### Deaths Analysis
Relative to the number of reported cases, the death count oscillates on a low scale between 0 and 7 throughout the given period with no clear trend indicating an increase or decrease in deaths. However, it's worth noting that from August 2016 through to the end of the data in March 2024, the number of deaths is predominantly nil despite the oscillating case numbers, which is a positive indicator of improved treatment and management of the disease. The highest number of deaths occurred in April 2015 with a data point of 7 deaths.
