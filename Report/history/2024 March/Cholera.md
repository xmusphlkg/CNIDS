## Introduction

Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It typically affects the small intestine, causing severe diarrhea and dehydration. The disease is spread primarily through contaminated water or food and is particularly prevalent in areas with poor sanitation and water treatment facilities. Symptoms generally appear between 12 hours and 5 days after exposure. Without quick treatment, cholera can be fatal. Areas with recurrent cholera outbreaks include parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

## Highlights

- Cholera cases in Mainland China appear sporadically but display a yearly trend of peaking during summer months, specifically between June and August, and declining during the rest of the year. <br/>
- Despite reported cholera cases, there have been no recorded cholera-attributable deaths during the observed ten-year period. This suggests effective immediate treatment and control measures. <br/>
- The data from the last three years (2021-2023) shows a general decrease in the number of cholera cases, which may be indicative of improved sanitation, public health education, or vaccination programs. <br/>
- As of March 2024, there have been no reported cases of cholera in the Chinese mainland.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Cholera in Mainland China saw unsteady occurrences from 2014 to 2024, with some periods like the second quarter of 2014, third quarter of 2016, and third quarter of 2018 seeing a mild increase in cases. Interestingly, the disease appears more prevalent in warmer months, implying a possibly seasonal trend. However, cases remain relatively low, never surpassing twelve instances within a month. Fluctuant but ceaseless presence of cases over the decade indicates an underlying perennial issue possibly linked to water sanitation or food safety that requires further exploration and public health actions.

### Deaths Analysis
Remarkably, despite the sporadic emergence of cholera instances in mainland China from 2014 to 2024, there have been no recorded deaths. This could be attributed to efficient medical management and early diagnosis, alongside access to healthcare. The zero mortality rate over this period indicates that, although cholera is present, its potential fatality is well mitigated. However, constant vigilance and continued monitoring of case management processes are required to maintain this remarkable record, considering the lethality potential of cholera if left untreated.
