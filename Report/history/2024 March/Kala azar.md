## Introduction

Kala Azar, also known as Visceral Leishmaniasis, is a widespread tropical and subtropical disease caused by a parasite, Leishmania donovani, transmitted through the bite of sandflies. The disease affects the body's internal organs, particularly the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, causing high fever, weight loss, anemia, and swelling of these organs. If left untreated, Kala Azar can be fatal. The disease is prevalent in certain regions of India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Brazil. Effective treatments are available, but access in endemic areas can be challenging. Disease control efforts focus on early detection and complete treatment.

## Highlights

- Trend of Kala azar cases has moderately fluctuated in China over the past 10 years, but overall the disease prevalence has plateaued to approximately 20-30 cases per month. <br/>
- Cases tend to increase during spring (March-April) and autumn (September-October), possibly correlating to seasonal variations affecting vector populations. <br/>
- A significant peak was observed in 2015 with 123 cases in November, but such high numbers have not recurred since, indicating successful control measures. <br/>
- Disease mortality is very low with only 6 deaths reported from 2014 to 2024, suggesting effective case management and treatment in the country. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data illustrates a fluctuating trend for cases of Kala azar in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024. There are certain noticeable spikes, particularly in October 2015 with 113 cases and November 2015 with 123 cases. However, over the years, the case reports show a trend of moderate decrease with slight increases during certain periods. In recent years, cases of Kala azar have generally ranged between approximately 15 and 35 cases monthly, with no apparent seasonal pattern and showing the disease has become less prevalent than in earlier years. 

### Deaths Analysis
Remarkably, the deaths due to Kala azar are extremely rare given the number of reported cases. Throughout these ten years, there have only been six reported deaths in total, accounting for less than 0.1% of the overall cases. These deaths are scattered over different years and months, indicating no clear correlation or trend. This low death rate suggests effective treatment and control measures have been put in place to manage Kala azar in the Chinese mainland, considering the potentially fatal nature of the disease.
