## Introduction

Neonatal tetanus is a severe bacterial infection caused by Clostridium tetani. This life-threatening disease primarily affects newborns and occurs when unsterilized instruments are used to cut the umbilical cord during birth. The bacteria produce toxins that can cause muscle rigidity and painful spasms, often leading to death if untreated. Despite being preventable through immunization and hygienic birth practices, neonatal tetanus remains a significant health issue in developing countries where healthcare services are limited.

## Highlights

1. A significant decrease in the number of neonatal tetanus cases in Chinese mainland over the years from 58 cases in September 2014 to 0 cases in March 2024 is observed.<br/>
2. The death rate due to neonatal tetanus also showed a declining trend. Frequencies of 2 deaths/month were common in 2014-2015, becoming irregular and then not reported after August 2022.<br/>
3. There's a consistent decline in cases each year, with a major reduction observed in 2017 when the number of cases dropped to single digits.<br/>
4. As of March 2024, Chinese mainland reported no new cases or deaths from neonatal tetanus, suggesting successful control measures.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of neonatal tetanus in mainland China exhibited a significant decreasing trend from 2014 to 2024. In 2014, cases ranged from 27 to 58 per month, suggesting a considerable burden of the disease. The numbers remained relatively steady through 2015 but began a steady decline from 2016 onwards, with the number of cases generally falling below 20 by 2017. By 2024, the number of monthly cases had dwindled to 0-3. Interventions including immunisation campaigns and improved antenatal care practices likely contributed to this marked decrease in cases.

### Deaths Analysis
There was a similar decreasing trend in reported neonatal tetanus deaths during the same period. Although the highest number of deaths recorded per month was only three, the mortality rate reduced from a consistent monthly presence to sporadic incidences by 2016. By 2023-2024, no deaths were reported, indicating a significant reduction in tetanus-related fatalities. Though the death incidence was already quite low, the steady decrease could be attributed to enhanced interventions, early detection, and improved treatment protocols.
