## Introduction

Influenza, often referred to as the flu, is a highly contagious viral infection affecting the respiratory system. It is caused by influenza viruses and is spread mainly by droplets made when people with the flu cough, sneeze or talk. Symptoms typically include fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. Influenza generally circulates yearly in the colder months and can lead to serious complications, particularly in high-risk groups including the very young, elderly, and those with underlying health conditions. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection.

## Highlights

1. Dramatic Increase in Cases: The influenza cases in the Chinese mainland have undergone a tremendous rise, especially since early 2023, reaching over 3 million cases in March 2023. <br/>
2. High Incidence Year-round: Unlike the conventional seasonality observed with influenza, high incidence rates were found all-year-round, suggesting a sustained transmission. <br/>
3. Lower Fatality Rates: Despite increased incidence, fatality rates have remained relatively low, highlighting a good clinical and health care response. <br/>
4. Recent Slight Decline: As of March 2024, although the situation remains severe with over 856,355 cases, there is a slight decline compared to the number of cases in early 2024 and late 2023.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data showed a general pattern of influenza cases increasing from 2014 to 2024, with significant spikes in Incidence in the colder months from December to February. Exceptionally, reported influenza cases experienced massive increases in March and December 2023, and January 2024, reaching over a million cases per month. These spikes represent the most severe influenza outbreak within the recorded period. However, the data also shows periods of a reduction following each peak, which could be attributed to effective intervention strategies and herd immunity.

### Deaths Analysis
Throughout the observed period, the number of deaths remained relatively low despite fluctuations in the number of cases. The highest recorded deaths occurred in January 2019 with 143 deaths. Even during severe spikes in the number of cases, the recorded deaths remained consistently low, indicating that the strain of influenza may not be particularly lethal, or that medical interventions were effective in preventing deaths. However, the consistency in low mortality rates warrants further investigation into the data's accuracy or reporting mechanisms for influenza-related deaths in the mainland.
