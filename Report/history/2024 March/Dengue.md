## Introduction

Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease widely spread in tropical and subtropical regions. It is caused by the dengue virus, which is transmitted to humans by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Common symptoms include high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, and mild bleeding. Severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, may lead to shock, organ failure, and death if not promptly treated. There is no specific treatment but early detection and access to proper medical care can reduce fatality rates.

## Highlights

- There are clear seasonal trends in Dengue cases, cases tend to peak around September/October and plummet during the winter months. <br/>
- A drastic reduction of Dengue cases was notable from 2020 until 2022, however, a resurgence in 2023 with a peak higher than previous years indicates Dengue is still a potential health threat. <br/>
- The fatality rate is extremely low and sporadic, indicating successful management of severe cases. <br/>
- As of March 2024, there are 38 confirmed cases and no deaths, a situation significantly better than September 2023, which saw the peak number of cases.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Dengue Fever in the Chinese Mainland has exhibited seasonality from 2014 to 2024. Cases typically peak in the months from August to October, followed by a steep drop in the winter months and a gradual rise in the summer months. The most significant upsurge was noticed in September 2014 and October 2014 with 14,759 and 28,796 cases respectively. The period from 2020 to early 2022 marked a notable decrease in cases, possibly due to effective control measures or prevailing pandemic circumstances. However, spikes in cases remained consistent post-summer 2022 and onwards. 

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the high number of cases, Dengue in the Chinese Mainland had a relatively low mortality rate from 2014 to 2024. Deaths remained at zero in nearly all reported months, with maximum monthly fatalities never surpassing 4, as depicted in September 2014. Nonetheless, sporadic deaths were reported in October 2014, February 2016, October and December 2017, and December 2018, indicating marginal lethality. Interestingly, no fatality was reported throughout the significant decrease in cases from 2020 to early 2022. From 2022 onwards, the pattern of scarce fatalities persisted, though the lethal incidence in September 2023 requires attention.
