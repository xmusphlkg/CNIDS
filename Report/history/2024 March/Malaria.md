## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening illness transmitted through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. Itâ€™s caused by Plasmodium parasites, with five different species causing the disease in humans. The parasite multiplies in the liver and infects red blood cells, causing symptoms like fever, headaches, and vomiting. Most malaria cases and deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa. However, South-East Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East are also at risk. Despite global efforts, it remains a significant health issue, especially for vulnerable populations like children and pregnant women.

## Highlights

- There's a marked decline in malaria cases from 2014 to 2022, with an exception in August 2022. This was followed by an uptrend in 2023 and 2024.<br/>
- Despite reduced cases, deaths from malaria remain sporadic with several months reporting no fatalities.<br/>
- Summer months since 2022 notably see a rise in cases, implying a potential seasonality.<br/>
- As of March 2024, 150 cases were reported with no deaths, a significant increase compared to the previous years from 2021-2023 but no fatalities were reported.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Malaria cases in mainland China have shown a decreasing trend from 2014 to 2020, with the highest cases reported in June 2015 (386 cases) and the lowest cases in May 2020 (40 cases). However, from 2020 to 2024, there was an increase in cases, with a significant spike in August 2022 (217 cases). Despite this increase, the cases reported are significantly less than the highest recorded in 2015. The data depicts cyclic patterns, with peaks typically occurring in the summer months - particularly in June and July - correlating with the mosquito breeding season. 

### Deaths Analysis
Over the same period, malaria-related deaths remained relatively low compared to the number of cases, with the maximum number of deaths reported in December 2019 (4 deaths). Despite the uptick in cases from 2020-2024, deaths remained stable, which may suggest improved treatment and handling of cases. Overall, there's no clear pattern in deaths concerning specific months. However, the death count has starkly decreased from 2014 to 2024 showing the consistent efforts of medical authorities in managing Malaria effectively.
