## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, life-threatening condition caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It interferes with the body's ability to fight infections and diseases by damaging the immune system. HIV is transmitted through body fluids including blood, semen, vaginal fluids and breast milk. Once infected, the virus significantly impairs the immune system, making the body more susceptible to a wide range of illnesses. Without treatment, the immune system could eventually become too weakened to fight off serious illnesses and infections.

## Highlights

- AIDS has witnessed a steady surge in mainland China with an upward trend in cases and deaths, indicating ongoing transmission and possibly insufficient treatment. <br/>
- The highest number of reported cases was noted in December 2024 at 7897, proclaiming it the peak month for infections.<br/>
- Deaths attributed to AIDS also peaked during December 2024, hitting a high of 2486 deaths.<br/>
- The data up to March 2024 establishes the same trend, emphasizing a pressing need for amplified efforts in prevention, testing, and treatment strategies.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Based on the presented data, the incidence of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in mainland China has displayed a generally fluctuating but increasing trend from March 2014 to March 2024. The lowest number of cases recorded was in January 2023 (1815), with a subsequent rise in the ensuing months. The peak of reported cases occurred in December 2021 with 7490 cases. It's crucial to note the increasing prevalence of cases towards the end of each year, requiring strategic public health attention during these periods.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality data for AIDS in mainland China has similarly shown a fluctuating yet upward trend over the same ten-year span. The number of deaths reached its peak in December 2021, accounting for 2486 fatalities. Conversely, the lowest reported AIDS-related deaths were in February 2015 with 624 fatalities. Interestingly, much like the incidence data, mortality rates tend to balloon towards the year-end. This observed pattern necessitates targeted interventions during these periods to curb the rising tide of fatalities.
