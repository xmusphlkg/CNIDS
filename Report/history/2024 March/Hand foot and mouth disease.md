## Introduction

Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a contagious illness primarily affecting children. It is caused by various viruses, predominantly the Coxsackie A16 virus. Symptoms include fever, blisters in the mouth, and rash on the hands and feet. The disease spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids or contaminated surfaces. While uncomfortable, HFMD is typically mild and resolves on its own within a week to ten days. Serious complications are rare, but can occur. There is no specific treatment, and prevention measures include proper personal hygiene.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The cases of Hand foot and mouth disease in Chinese mainland display a seasonal trend, with the majority of cases occurring from April to July every year across the time-frame of 2014 to 2024. The highest number of cases were reported in 2014 with a peak in May, gradually decreasing towards November and drastically decreasing further in the subsequent winter. The lowest number of cases occurred in 2020 during the pandemic. Overall, although there's a significant reduction in the number of cases from 2014 till 2020, probable due to increased prevention and control measures, there is a consistent trend of spiking cases mid-year.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the high number of cases, the fatality rate of the disease remains low. Peak deaths occurred in 2014 and gradually decreased each year till 2020, followed by sporadic single-digit deaths. April to June consistently recorded the highest deaths each year, correlating with the high incidence of cases during this period. In the entirety of 2020 and onward, deaths decreased drastically, with many months recording zero deaths despite continuous cases. This could be attributed to improved medical procedures, increased early detection, and timely treatment of the disease.
