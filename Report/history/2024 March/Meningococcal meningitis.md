## Introduction

Meningococcal meningitis is a severe bacterial infection of the meninges, the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. This infection is highly contagious, frequently fatal if not treated promptly, and can cause serious complications, like brain damage or hearing loss. It primarily affects babies, children, and young adults. The disease is characterized by sudden onset of symptoms such as fever, a stiff neck, a severe headache, nausea, confusion, and sensitivity to light. Vaccines are available and recommended in areas with high incidence rates.

## Highlights

- Overall decrease in Meningococcal meningitis cases from 2014 to 2024; highest incidence in 2014 with 33 cases in May, and the lowest in 2021 with 0 cases in August. <br/>
- Noticeable seasonal trends; higher number of cases generally reported from January to April and in December, aligning with China's colder months.<br/>
- Significant reduction in deaths since 2020, with zero deaths reported most months from 2020 onwards.<br/>
- Despite the overall reduction, there was a slight uptick in cases in December 2023 and early 2024, but with fewer fatalities.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Meningococcal meningitis in mainland China fluctuates over the years (2014-2024), reaching its highest in May 2014 with 33 cases and gradually reducing to 15 cases by March 2024. An observable trend is the seasonal surge of cases during the colder months (November to February) and declines during warmer months. However, there are discrepancies in this trend suggesting other factors such as public awareness, diagnostic methods and reporting processes might be at play.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality rate due to Meningococcal meningitis scattered across the years with tiny spikes in January 2015 and December 2017, each recording 4 and 6 deaths respectively. Impressively, the reported deaths have been relatively low in recent years, demonstrating an efficient response and effective utilization of healthcare resources. The mortality trends indicate better disease management but continuous monitoring is necessary due to irregular instances of multiple deaths in a month.
