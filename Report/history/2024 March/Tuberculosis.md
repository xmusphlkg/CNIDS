## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a highly infectious bacterial disease caused primarily by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and mainly affects the lungs, though it can spread to other organs. TB is typically spread through airborne particles when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Patients often exhibit persistent coughing, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. Vaccination, early detection, and long-term antibiotic treatment are the main means of controlling the disease. Despite advances in treatment and prevention, TB remains a major global health concern.

## Highlights

- Tuberculosis (TB) cases in the Chinese mainland have generally decreased over the past decade from approximately 111,975 cases in March 2014 to around 70,013 cases in March 2024. <br/>
- The number of TB-related deaths, however, has shown an alarming upward trend in the same period, rising from 153 deaths in March 2014 to 295 deaths in March 2024.<br/>
- The data reveals notable seasonal variance in TB cases, usually peaking in March and then gradually decreasing until September/October. <br/>
- The spike in TB-related deaths in January 2022 is anomalous and could be attributed to factors such as intensified case finding, improved death reporting, or increased disease severity. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From the data, the average monthly reported Tuberculosis cases in mainland China from March 2014 to March 2024 is about 92,000 cases. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of cases remained relatively high, peaking at about 114,000 cases. There was a significant reduction in the number of cases in early 2020, possibly due to the impact of Covid-19 and the associated lockdown measures. However, the number of cases started to increase again towards the end of 2020, and by 2024, the monthly cases rose back to about 70,000.

### Deaths Analysis
The average monthly deaths due to Tuberculosis in mainland China is approximately 177 deaths, from March 2014 to March 2024. The number of deaths showed a general increasing trend over this period, with a noticeable jump in January 2022. Even though there were fluctuations throughout the decade, the mortality rate due to Tuberculosis continues to rise. With relatively stable cases, this may signify issues with healthcare access or the effectiveness of treatments, demanding further investigation.
