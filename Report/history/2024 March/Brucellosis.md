## Introduction

Brucellosis is a bacterial infection caused by various Brucella species, commonly transmitted to humans from animals through consumption of unpasteurized milk or undercooked meat, or by close contact with their secretions. Predominantly affecting livestock, it represents a significant agricultural burden. Symptoms in humans range from mild fever, fatigue, and joint pain to severe complications involving the heart and central nervous system. Brucellosis presents diagnostic challenges and requires prolonged antibiotic treatment. Globally, it is considered a neglected zoonosis with higher prevalence in the Mediterranean regions, Western Asia, and Africa.

## Highlights

- Resurgence in Brucellosis cases noted from 2019, peaking at 9,670 in June 2021 despite initial decline between 2016-2018.<br/>
- A consistent seasonal trend observed with peak incidents occurring in warmer months (May-Jul).<br/>
- Fatality remains extremely low; occasional deaths recorded but no significant increase in mortality within the period under review.<br/>
- March 2024 data shows 6,197 cases, no deaths; slight case rate decline compared to same period the previous year (6,543 cases).


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data indicates a seasonal pattern of Brucellosis cases in mainland China, with a higher number of incidences reported from April to September. Though more severe in some years, the trend seems consistent. Despite considerable fluctuation, there is an overall rise in cases from 2014 to 2024, indicating the disease is spreading. The peaks in 2021 and 2022 particularly, with 9670 and 9943 cases reported in June respectively, reflect a considerable increase. The lowest number of cases (1820) was recorded in December 2022, possibly due to interventions or seasonal factors.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality rate due to Brucellosis is remarkably low despite high reported cases, indicating either negligible fatality rate or inadequate recording of death data. Deaths occur sporadically throughout the years without an apparent pattern. The highest number of deaths (2) occurred in July 2018, July 2021, and September 2023. It's worth noting that fatalities do not necessarily correlate with the highest case numbers. For example, despite recording the highest cases in June 2021 (9670) and 2022 (9943), no deaths were reported in these months.
