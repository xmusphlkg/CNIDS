## Introduction

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a type of parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma flatworms. The parasites inhabit freshwater, penetrating human skin upon contact. Inside the body, they grow into adult worms that lay eggs leading to various symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and blood in urine or stool. Chronic cases may result in liver damage, kidney failure or bladder cancer. The disease primarily targets populations in Africa, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Asia. It's preventable through the provision of clean water, better sanitation, and regular drug treatments.

## Highlights

1. A significant decline in Schistosomiasis cases was observed from 2014 to 2024. Case numbers decreased from a peak of approximately 10,481 in November 2015 to a single case in March 2024.<br/>
2. The trend shows a drastic reduction after 2015, with occasional minor peaks, notably in 2017. After 2018, new cases reduced to double digits and maintained at a low level.<br/>
3. For most of the recorded period, no fatalities were reported. However, in February 2020, a single death was recorded.<br/>
4. By March of 2024, the monthly caseload has diminished to only one case signifying a nearly eradicated disease landscape.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Over the decade starting from 2014, the number of Schistosomiasis cases reported in mainland China shows a significant fluctuation. Initial figures in 2014-2015 saw cases in hundreds ranging from 135 to over 10000. The most considerable spike occurred in late 2015 with cases exceeding 10000. Moving into 2016, an overall downward trend in infection rate was reported with most figures ranging from several hundreds to thousands. Notably, the data suggests a significant reduction in cases reported from 2017 onward, with numbers dropping consistently to double digits and particularly low figures below 40 from 2020 onwards.

### Deaths Analysis
Interestingly, despite the high level of infections in the earlier years, death cases remained surprisingly low throughout the reported period. Only one death case was recorded in February 2020. The low fatality rate may suggest that, while infections were prevalent, effective treatments and control strategies were implemented to manage the disease's progression. The consistently low death rate even amidst the high infection count signifies a good handling of the disease in terms of treatment administration and health management.
