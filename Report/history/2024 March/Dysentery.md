## Introduction

Dysentery is an infectious disease associated with severe diarrhea accompanied by blood or mucus in the feces. It's typically caused by Shigella bacteria (bacillary dysentery) or amoeba, particularly Entamoeba histolytica (amoebic dysentery). Transmission predominantly occurs due to poor hygiene, often through contaminated food or water. The condition results in stomach cramps, fever, and dehydration. The disease is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions with poor sanitation. Prevention includes good personal hygiene, proper sanitation, and safe food and water practices.

## Highlights

- Data shows a clear seasonal pattern of dysentery in mainland China with peaks during summer, and notably reduced cases over the decade from 2014 to 2024.<br/>
- Despite peak seasons, no specific trends in the low fatality counts are observed.<br/>
- As of March 2024, there were 2087 cases and no deaths, suggesting ongoing reduction in case incidence.<br/>
- The continual yearly decrease suggests improved strategies in dysentery prevention and control.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Dysentery cases in mainland China from 2014 to 2024 reveals a periodic pattern of peaks in mid-year and troughs in winter months. All years show highest incidences from May to August, corresponding to warmer months. By contrast, the lowest rates typically occur in colder months, namely January and February. Furthermore, an overall downward trend in cases is evident when comparing peak months (July) across the ten-year span. At peak, cases decreased from 22,311 in July 2014 to 4,684 in July 2023, suggesting effective management strategies and perhaps increased population immunity.

### Deaths Analysis
Mortality due to Dysentery across this period is remarkably low compared to the incidence rates. Such differential may indicate that either the strain of Dysentery present is less virulent, or health services are effective in treating the disease in a timely manner. Deaths are scattered across all months without a discernible pattern or peak, and most months report zero deaths. While the absolute number of deaths fluctuates, the death rate per case decreases over the timeframe, suggesting improving health outcomes for those affected.
