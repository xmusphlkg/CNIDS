## Introduction

Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus that passes from one person to another through saliva, nasal secretions, or close personal contact. Mumps primarily affects the salivary glands and manifests symptoms such as fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite followed by swollen and painful salivary glands. The disease can lead to severe complications if contracted by adults. Vaccination is the most effective prevention method. The mumps vaccine is generally given in combination with measles and rubella (MMR).

## Highlights

- There is a significant decrease in reported mumps cases in recent years, with a peak in 2019 (37913 cases in June) to below 10000 cases per month by 2024.<br/>
- The disease appears to follow a seasonal pattern, with higher incidences typically observed between April and June, and a decrease towards the end of the year.<br/>
- There have been minimal mumps-related deaths reported across the entire period suggesting it's not commonly fatal.<br/>
- Although decreases in reported cases may appear positive, it also could indicate underreporting or changes in surveillance intensity. Further investigation would be needed.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Chinese mainland has experienced surges and declines of Mumps cases from 2014 through 2024. Generally, cases peaked around the spring and summer months, such as in May 2019 with 36,669 cases, and then declined over the fall and winter. There were evident trends of yearly fluctuations, with the highest rates reported between 2018 to 2019, then a sharp decrease was observed in 2020 possibly attributable to enhanced health measures due to COVID-19. The total number of cases started rebounding in 2021 but not reaching to the peaks observed in previous years, suggesting some form of control or preventive measures might be in place.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite a high number of reported cases during the period from 2014 to 2024, the death toll remarkably remained low, with some years reporting zero deaths, e.g., 2015 and 2016. The highest number of deaths occurred in 2020, with five reported deaths, while years like 2014 and 2017 recorded only one. This low fatality rate of mumps in mainland China highlights the effectiveness of the disease management and treatment protocols. It also indicates that the region's health system was efficient in handling the cases, ensuring most patients recovered, despite the high case loads.
