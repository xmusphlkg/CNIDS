## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a parasitic infection caused by the larval stages of the tiny tapeworm, Echinococcus. It is transmitted through accidental ingestion of parasite eggs excreted by infected carnivores, primarily dogs. Two main species infect humans, Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis, causing cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis respectively. The disease often results in slow-growing cysts in the liver, lungs, and other organs, leading to complications like liver failure and lung disease. Prognosis depends on the cysts' location, size, and whether they have spread.

## Highlights

- Echinococcosis cases in mainland China displayed an overall upward trend from March 2014 to March 2017, with the monthly count of cases peaking at 1077 in March 2017. <br/>
- Post-2017, a general decrease in the case count can be observed, with intermittent resurgences, such as in December 2021 and January 2024. <br/>
- Recorded deaths are significantly fewer, with scattered occurrences throughout the years. The highest number of deaths in a single month was two in February 2019. <br/>
- By March 2024, the monthly case count has notably risen again to 534, but no deaths were reported in that month.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Echinococcosis cases in mainland China from 2014 through 2024 show a fluctuating trend, with noticeably high and low reports during specific periods. Case numbers started decreasing towards end of 2014 but rose again in 2015 before peaking at 1077 in March 2017. A general decrease is observed after this peak, aside from a few subsequent upward spikes. Interestingly, cases reduced drastically in February 2020. The data clearly shows a seasonality pattern, with case counts showing an increasing trend during the first few months of the year. These patterns suggest variable exposure and dynamic infection rates of Echinococcosis in the population.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the fluctuating number of Echinococcosis cases, the mortality rate from 2014 to 2024 is relatively low within mainland China. Only eight deaths are reported in total, scattered sporadically over the 10 years. The first death was recorded in July 2015. The data shows no clear pattern or trend regarding deaths, suggesting that while infection rates may fluctuate, the actual fatality rate from Echinococcosis remains low. It infers a relatively high survival rate and effective management measures, which is a positive indicator for public health.
