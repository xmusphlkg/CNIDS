## Introduction

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the Hepatitis A virus. It is most commonly transmitted through the ingestion of food or water contaminated by the feces of an infected person. Symptoms include fatigue, low appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and jaundice, but not everyone has symptoms. There is an effective vaccine for prevention and good personal hygiene can also reduce risk. While it can cause severe symptoms, unlike other types of viral hepatitis, Hepatitis A does not lead to chronic liver disease.

## Highlights

- Significant decrease in Hepatitis A cases in China observed over a decade, with a peak of 2733 cases in Dec 2014 to 1542 in March 2024. <br/>
- Seasonal spikes typically occur during the summer months, potentially due to climatic factors. <br/>
- Mortality rates remain low, albeit an increase to two deaths occurred in March 2024, the highest since 2015.<br/>
- Overall, Hepatitis A prevalence has substantially declined in China by March 2024, whilst mortality remains relatively small.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported Hepatitis A cases in Mainland China showed a downward trend from 2014 to 2024. The peak number occurred in December 2014 with 2733 cases, and the lowest number was recorded in December 2022 with only 532 cases. Monthly fluctuations were seen, but the overall tendency depicts a progressive decrease in the number of cases. This trend suggests that public health measures, including sanitation improvement and vaccination, might be effectively controlling the incidence of Hepatitis A in Mainland China. 

### Deaths Analysis
Hepatitis A related deaths remained relatively low throughout these years, with the largest number of fatalities being four in December 2015. Zero death records were most common across all months. Surprisingly, even though the total cases drastically decreased over the years, the quantity of deaths didn't show a clear decreasing trend, with two deaths still occurring in March 2024. This indicates that while infection control has improved, further efforts may be required to better manage and treat the disease for those infected.
