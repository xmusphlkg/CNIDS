## Introduction

Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is characterized by severe coughing spells that end in a "whooping" sound when the person breathes in. Infants and young children are most at risk. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets from close contact with an infected person. Vaccination, typically via the DTaP or Tdap vaccines, is the primary preventative measure. Despite a reduction in pertussis cases following vaccine introduction, outbreaks continue to occur.

## Highlights

- An increasing trend in the number of Pertussis cases in the Chinese mainland is evident, with peaks observed in 2024, specifically in February and March with 17105 and 27078 cases respectively. <br/>
- Fatality remains low despite the rising incidence, but increased to 5 and 8 deaths in January and February 2024, suggesting a slight increase in disease severity.<br/>
- Significant drop in cases was observed in 2020 with a slow increase in cases beginning from July 2021, which suggests a potential cyclic nature of this disease.<br/>
- Overall, pertussis seems to be highly endemic, and the recent surge in 2024 warrants immediate intervention.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported case data for Pertussis in China's mainland from March 2014 to March 2024 indicates a steady increase over the years, with some fluctuations observed. The earliest recorded cases were comparatively low, with a slight increase over the summer months. Notably, this upward trend persisted over the years, with the highest case count being reported in March 2024, with a total of 27,078 cases. There were also noticeable dips in the cases at certain periods, such as in 2020, attributed to the global efforts in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the surveillance and reporting of other illnesses.

### Deaths Analysis
Death count due to Pertussis in China's mainland over this period was remarkably low given the large number of cases. The data suggests a noteworthy predominance of cases over deaths, indicating effective management and treatment for the majority of those affected. It is vital to highlight that the highest mortality, 8 deaths, corresponded with the significant increase in cases in February 2024. However, for a majority of the months within this ten-year period, the death count remained at 0 or 1. The low mortality rate demonstrates a robust medical response in treating this disease.
