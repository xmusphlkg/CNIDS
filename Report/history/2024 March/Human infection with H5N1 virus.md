## Introduction

Human infection with H5N1 virus, also known as avian influenza or bird flu, is a highly contagious viral illness. H5N1 is primarily found in birds, but infections can occur in humans after direct or indirect contact with infected poultry. The virus can cause severe illness or death in humans, with symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, and sometimes severe respiratory diseases such as pneumonia. It's important to note, however, that the virus cannot yet be transmitted efficiently among humans. Efforts to monitor and control the virus are watchful, as mutation or reassortment may enable this capability.


## Highlights

- There has been no significant activity or outbreak of H5N1 in the Chinese mainland since 2016, with only sporadic cases in 2022 and 2023. <br/>
- There are no reported cases or deaths from the H5N1 virus in Chinese mainland in the current year (2024) up to March. <br/>
- The H5N1 virus maintained a high mortality rate, with 6 deaths out of 9 reported cases during the span of activity from 2015 to 2016. <br/>
- Overall, the trend shows that the virus is largely under control, with a continuing decrease in cases and deaths since 2016.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From the period of March 2014 to March 2024, the Chinese mainland demonstrated few instances of human infection with the H5N1 virus. An initial peak of cases transpired in early 2015, with 7 recorded instances across a five-month span. Afterward, the frequency of infection proved sporadic, dropping off into extended periods void of any reported infections from late 2016 and for majority of 2017 through 2022. However, there have been rare, isolated instances specifically in 2022 and 2023, suggesting the potential persistence of the virus in the environment or animal hosts. 

### Deaths Analysis
The pattern in deaths resulted from the H5N1 virus aligns with the incidence of cases. The initial cases in 2015 were significantly deadly, boasting a high case-fatality rate with 6 deaths among the 7 reported infections. 2016 also depicted a high fatality rate with 2 deaths among 2 reported cases. Post-2016, the severity of the disease seems to have decreased or containment measures may have improved, given the lack of any associated deaths in the sporadic instances that occurred. Precisely, no deaths associated with the H5N1 virus have been reported since May 2016.
