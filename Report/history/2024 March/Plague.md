## Introduction

Plague is a severe, potentially fatal infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It primarily affects rodents and is spread to humans through fleas or contact with contaminated fluid or tissue from infected animals. The disease has three forms: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic. Symptoms include fever, weakness, and swollen lymph nodes. It played a significant role in human history, causing pandemics such as the Black Death in the 14th century. While it is rare now, it still poses health risks in certain parts of the world.

## Highlights

- The Plague in mainland China has shown sporadic incidences over the last 10 years with a total of 14 cases and 9 deaths since 2014.<br/>
- There has been an observable recent surge, with the highest number of cases occurring in November 2019 (4 cases) and August 2023 (4 cases).<br/>
- The mortality rate for the disease as of March 2024 is around 64%, indicating a high fatality ratio amongst reported cases.<br/>
- Despite small increases, the general trend suggests the situation is reasonably under control with reported cases remaining very low on an annual basis.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Plague cases in mainland China, from March 2014 to March 2024, appear to be sparse yet periodically recurring. The total reported cases during this ten-year span were 14, with the largest number of cases (4) recorded in November 2019. Interestingly, the Plague cases seem to mostly occur in the second half of the years especially July-December, albeit inconsistently across years. It is noteworthy that there were several zero-case yearsâ€”2015 and several months in 2016, 2017, and 2023.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality rate corresponding to the cases has been extremely high. Over the decade, 8 deaths occurred out of the 14 cases, representing a fatality rate of approximately 57%. Notably, 100% fatality was recorded in July and October 2014, and December 2017, suggesting that the plague appeared particularly virulent in those periods. However, there have been instances, such as June 2016 and July 2020, where the occurrence of the disease did not result in any death, indicating possible improvements in disease management or variability in plague strains.
