## Introduction

Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly infectious, rapidly spreading viral eye disease. It's caused primarily by two viruses: enterovirus 70 and coxsackievirus A24. Symptoms include sudden onset of painful, swollen, red eyes, watery discharge, light sensitivity, and sometimes, systemic symptoms like fever and respiratory issues. Though it's usually self-limiting with recovery observed in 1-2 weeks, it can cause significant discomfort and temporary vision impairment, disrupting daily activities. AHC has led to widespread epidemics in various parts of the world.

## Highlights

- There is a dramatic surge in Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis cases in 2023, particularly in September (125,264 cases). The cause warrants investigation.<br/>
- Despite rising cases, few deaths are tied to the disease, indicating a low mortality rate.<br/>
- The disease shows a seasonal peak in summer months, exaggerated in 2023.<br/>
- As of March 2024 (2676 cases), the situation seems to be reverting to pre-2023 levels. Ongoing surveillance is critical.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Data for Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in the Chinese mainland depicts a cyclical upward trend since 2014. Typically, cases peak between June and September, then gradually decrease towards the end of the year. The number of cases tends to be lower during the beginning of each year, which increases gradually until the middle of the year. The most significant spikes in the case numbers were noticed in September 2014 and September 2023, suggesting a likely outbreak and the necessity for intensified control measures. The overall trend indicates expansion in the spread of this disease condition.

### Deaths Analysis
Analysis of mortality over the years showed a remarkably low fatality, thus indicating an almost benign course of the disease. Only three deaths have been recorded from 2014 to 2024. The first occurred in August 2019, the second and third in February 2020. Despite an arresting surge in cases in 2023, particularly in September, no coinciding rise in deaths was observed, further substantiating the low fatality nature of this disease. Although Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is notably prevalent in China, it seems to cause minimal mortalities thus far.
