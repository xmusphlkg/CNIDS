## Introduction

Hepatitis C is a viral infection primarily affecting the liver, caused by the Hepatitis C virus. It often manifests as a silent, chronic infection, potentially leading to serious liver damage, cirrhosis, or even liver cancer over decades. The infection is primarily transmitted through direct blood-to-blood contact, often via shared drug injection equipment, unscreened blood transfusions, or unsafe medical practices. Hepatitis C does not always show noticeable symptoms, making its diagnosis challenging. There is no vaccine, but treatment options have dramatically improved in recent years and can eradicate the virus in most cases.

## Highlights

- There is a notable increase in Hepatitis C-related deaths since 2022, with counts rising to triple figures. <br/>
- The number of cases over the years largely fluctuates between 15,000 - 24,000, with a significant dip to around 11,000 in December 2022.<br/>
- The overall case counts reveal relatively stable transmission rates over the years without any significant decrease or increase.<br/>
- The recent data from 2024 shows an alarming rise in deaths, underscoring a critical situation and the urgency for intervention. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From the provided data, it's clear that the number of Hepatitis C cases in the Chinese mainland exhibits some seasonality, with the highest annual observed count usually occurring in March. Additionally, there has been a general downward trend in the number of reported cases over the 10-year period from 2014 to 2024, notably despite slight upticks in 2015, 2017, and 2023. The substantial drop in the reported cases in 2020 February might be due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding disruption of normal health services.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll from Hepatitis C in the Chinese mainland is relatively stable from 2014 to mid-2022, with an average of around 10 deaths per month. However, a dramatic rise in deaths is observed from mid-2022, peaking at 393 deaths in December 2023. The steep increase only drops slightly in early 2024. This catastrophic surge might suggest a delay in diagnosis and proper intervention, which warrants urgent public health attention and response to curb further mortality.
