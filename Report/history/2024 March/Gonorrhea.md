## Introduction

Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It can affect both men and women, particularly infecting warm, moist areas of the body such as the urethra, eyes, throat, vagina, anus, and female reproductive tract. The infection often has no symptoms, making it difficult to detect without testing. However, untreated gonorrhea can lead to serious health complications including Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in women and epididymitis in men, both potentially leading to infertility. The disease is preventable and typically treatable with antibiotics.

## Highlights

- An annual pattern is observed in Gonorrhea cases in mainland China, with peaks in summer and troughs in February, from 2014-2024. <br/>
- A significant dip in cases in 2020 might be due to lower clinic attendance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Numbers bounced back in 2021. <br/>
- Mortality rates remain very low, signaling effective treatments, with monthly numbers varying between 0 and 4 deaths. <br/>
- The high case numbers suggest inadequate prevention strategies, possibly due to insufficient sex education and protective measures.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, reported Gonorrhea cases in Chinese mainland show a general upward trend annually, typically peaking in late summer (August) each year. The highest number of reported cases was in August 2017, at 13,803 cases, and the lowest point, except in early months of each year, was in December 2022, with 6,027 cases. A noticeable drop in cases was observed in 2020, potentially due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health measures, which may have reduced sexual contact or improved safe sex practices.

### Deaths Analysis
Gonorrhea-related deaths in the mainland China are sporadic and rare, despite the large number of cases. Between 2014 and 2024, there were only 12 months wherein fatalities occurred. The highest fatality number in a month happened in January 2020 with four reported deaths. A majority of the deaths occurred in winter months (December, January), with February seemingly safer with no reported deaths. Overall, Gonorrhea has a low fatality rate in China, possibly due to effective interventions like early detection and treatment or limited severe complications.
