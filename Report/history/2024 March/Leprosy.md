## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae bacteria. It primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes, leading to potential injury and disability. Leprosy is characterized by long incubation periods, usually about five years but it can range up to 20 years. Despite its alarming symptoms, leprosy can be effectively treated with a multi-drug therapy. However, if left untreated, the disease can cause severe nerve damage and disability.

## Highlights

- Declining trend in cases: Leprosy cases have generally declined from 86 in March 2014 to 53 in March 2024. <br/>
- Seasonal pattern: Lower case counts are typically reported in winter months (November to February). <br/>
- Few fatalities: From 2014 to 2024, only two reported deaths occurred due to Leprosy, indicating high survival rates. <br/>
- Current Leprosy status: As of March 2024, 53 cases reported, no fatalities, suggesting managed prevalence of the disease in mainland China.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data from 2014 to 2024 shows a gradual decrease in reported leprosy cases in mainland China. An initial high of 86 cases in March 2014 gradually declined to 53 cases by March 2024, dipping to a low of 13 cases in October 2022. Variations in reported cases occur seasonally, with peaks often seen in the warmer and more humid months, likely due to increased bacterial survival and transmission rates during these periods. However, long-term trends indicate successful efforts to control and prevent the disease.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the consistent presence of leprosy cases, mainland China's death rate from the disease has remained extraordinarily low. Within the ten-year period between 2014 and 2024, only three deaths were reportedâ€” in January 2016, August 2019, and December 2021. This could be attributed to early detection, effective treatment protocols, public health campaigns increasing disease awareness, and ensuring patients receive necessary care. However, continuous surveillance and preventive measures are essential to maintain this low mortality rate.
