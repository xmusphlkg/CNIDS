## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by the spirochete bacterium Treponema pallidum. Traditionally classified into four stages, primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary, each stage is associated with specific signs and symptoms ranging from sores and rashes to serious complications affecting the heart, brain, and other organs if left untreated. It can also spread from an infected mother to her unborn child, a condition termed as 'congenital syphilis'. Despite being a centuries-old disease, syphilis remains a significant public health concern worldwide.

## Highlights

- There's a general increasing trend in the number of Syphilis cases in Chinese mainland from around 36,000 in March 2014 to nearly 64,000 in March 2024. <br/>
- Death rates remain relatively low compared to the number of cases, however, a spike in deaths is noticeable in January 2020, reaching 25. <br/>
- Despite seasonal fluctuations, a notable increase in cases occurs approximately every July, representing a potential seasonality factor in disease transmission. <br/>
- Overall, the situation points toward an increasing burden of Syphilis in China, emphasizing the need for continued surveillance and control efforts.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Syphilis cases in the Chinese mainland have displayed an overall growing trend from March 2014 to March 2024. A cyclical pattern is seen in the data, where the case count surges and contracts annually. The numbers typically decline at the start of the year and rise towards the middle of the year. The highest number of cases was observed in March 2024, with 64,161 cases. Despite some periodical downswings, such as in December 2022 with 24,367 cases, the general trend suggests a continuous growth in syphilis cases over this period.

### Deaths Analysis
The analysis of the death figures between March 2014 and March 2024 shows a relatively stable pattern with some fluctuation, but without a distinct upward or downward trend. The highest reported death count in a month was in January 2020, with 25 deaths, and the lowest was in May 2016 & May 2022, with no reported deaths. The steadily low death figures despite rising case counts might indicate effective medical management and treatment of syphilis. However, the consistency of deaths suggests persistent transmission in the Chinese mainland.
