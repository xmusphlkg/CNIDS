## Introduction

Scarlet fever, also known as Scarlatina, is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. It primarily affects children and is characterized by a distinctive red rash, sore throat, and high fever. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain and a strawberry-like appearance of the tongue. The disease is spread through respiratory droplets and can be treated with antibiotics. Though once fatal, scarlet fever is now much less threatening but can lead to serious complications if left untreated. Prior exposure or vaccination generally provides immunity.

## Highlights

- Scarlet fever in the Chinese mainland presents strong seasonality, with cases peaking between April and June each year from 2014-2024. <br/>
- There was a noticeable decrease in cases from 2019 to 2020, with the lowered numbers persisting till 2024. Causes remain unclear. <br/>
- Fatality rate for Scarlet fever is low, with only three deaths recorded between 2014 and 2024. <br/>
- As of March 2024, the case count is 3610, consistent with expected seasonal increases seen in previous years.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Scarlet fever cases in mainland China manifested seasonality across the years, with high counts typically observed in spring (May/June) and winter (December/January). However, a dramatic decrease occurred in 2020, with cases not exceeding the 3000 mark until 2023. The reason could be stringent health practices due to COVID-19. After this dip, cases improved, but have not yet returned to pre-2020 levels, with a peak at 6255 cases in January 2024.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the large number of scarlet fever cases, the mortality rate is almost negligible. Over the years, only three deaths are reported with the disease in Chinese mainland in this dataset covering 10 years. This suggests that the healthcare system has effectively managed and controlled the impact of the disease in terms of mortality. It would be interesting to explore the implementation of strategies such as vaccination or notification, which has led to an almost zero mortality rate.
