## Introduction

Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, primarily affecting livestock and wild game. Humans can become infected through direct or indirect contact with sick animals, or by exposure to anthrax spores used as a biological weapon. The disease manifests in three forms: cutaneous, inhalation, and gastrointestinal. Symptoms vary based on the type but may include skin ulcers, difficulty breathing, and severe diarrhea. Anthrax is a serious global health concern, but early detection and treatment can improve survival rates.


## Highlights

- A recurring seasonal trend in Anthrax cases is evident in China, peaking in summer (July and August), with cases in recent years surpassing 100 in peak months.<br/>
- Despite fluctuations, the highest yearly cases are increasing, with a record 123 cases (August 2023) to date.<br/>
- Most months see no deaths, though occasional instances peak at two in certain months.<br/>
- As of March 2024, there are 30 cases, no deaths; higher than previous years' March data, reflecting an off-season spike.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data for Anthrax cases in mainland China from 2014 to 2024 shows a recurring annual trend, with a gradual increase in infections starting from April, peaking typically around August, then decreasing through to March of the following year. The number of cases in high risk periods, notably between July and September, appears to increase over the years, with the highest number recorded at 123 cases in August 2023. Despite this peak, there's a general decline in new cases towards the end of the surveyed period. 

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the relatively high number of reported Anthrax cases, death rates remain comparatively low. Deaths due to Anthrax are sporadic, with 16 reported instances over a span of 10 years. There is no discernable recurrent monthly pattern in the death rates; however, most deaths appear to occur in the months with huge case numbers, specifically July, August and December. An increasing trend in deaths is not observed within the covered period. Crucially, even in the months with the highest recorded cases, the number of deaths did not exceed two.
