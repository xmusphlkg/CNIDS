## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a severe liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). It can be acute or chronic, varying in severity from a mild illness to a serious, lifelong condition that can lead to liver disease or cancer. Transmission commonly occurs through exposure to blood or body fluids of an infected person. It can also spread from mother to child during birth. Despite it being a major global health issue, there is an effective vaccine for prevention. Chronic cases require long-term medical management to prevent liver complications.


## Highlights

- Significant increase in Hepatitis B cases on the Chinese mainland is evident over the past decade, with monthly cases rising from below 100,000 in 2014 to consistently above 100,000 in 2024.<br/>
- March 2024 marked the peak at 152,967 cases, significantly exceeding prior year levels.<br/>
- Death rates, however, have remained stable, typically between 20-60 per month, with a slight decrease in 2024.<br/>
- Despite an increase in cases, constant death rates suggest progress in treatment and prevention.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between 2014 and 2024, Hepatitis B cases in the Chinese mainland show an increasing trend. After a notable dip in early 2020, possibly due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, cases rose steadily in subsequent years. A significant peak can be observed in March 2024, with over 150,000 cases reported, almost a 50% increase compared to the number a decade earlier. Possible reasons for this surge may include increased surveillance and diagnosis, improved reporting, and possibly higher transmission rates.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths associated with Hepatitis B remains relatively low compared to the case numbers, indicating it might not be a highly lethal disease, perhaps due to advances in treatment and medical care. The highest death count in a month was recorded to be 80 in 2020 January. It is noteworthy that there are fluctuations in death counts throughout these years, but with no clear increasing or decreasing trend. The death count might reflect changes in case management, diagnosis capacity, and healthcare accessibility.
