## Introduction

Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever, also known as Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), is a severe, acute viral disease spread by rodents, primarily rats and mice. The infection, typically found in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, is potentially fatal. It manifests as a sudden, febrile illness followed by various hemorrhagic symptoms and kidney involvement, potentially leading to shock and acute renal failure. Humans contract the virus through exposure to rodent urine, droppings, or saliva. It is not contagious from person to person.

## Highlights

- Epidemic hemorrhagic fever cases show a yearly cycle, peaking in November and falling in February/March. <br/>
- Over the past decade, there's been a gradual decline in cases, from over 1000 cases monthly in 2014, to below 500 in 2024. <br/>
- A similar downward trend is seen in fatalities, from double digits in early years to single digits or none from 2020 onward. <br/>
- As of March 2024, the disease seems controlled with just 234 cases and zero deaths reported.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The trend for Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF) cases in mainland China fluctuates seasonally from 2014 to 2024. A surge in reported cases occurs during the late autumn and winter seasons, while there is a decrease in the summer and early autumn seasons. This pattern suggests that the disease's occurrence may be related to environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation, which often affect vectors' breeding and activity cycles. The highest reported case in this period was in December 2021 with 2402 cases.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll corresponds variably with the number of reported cases. It can be observed that reported deaths also tend to increase late in the year, with November and December often showing the highest mortality figures. The highest peak is found in November 2018 with 33 deaths. Despite substantial case fluctuations, the comparatively steady death count indicates a stable case fatality rate, suggesting consistent diagnosis and treatment practices throughout the period. This data underlines the disease's seriousness and the need for continued surveillance and control efforts.
