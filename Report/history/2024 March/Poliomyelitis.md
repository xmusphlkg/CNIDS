## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, typically referred to as polio, is a highly infectious viral disease that primarily affects young children. The virus, transmitted person to person, typically through contaminated water or food, invades the nervous system and can lead to total paralysis in a matter of hours. Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness in the neck, and pain in the limbs. While there is no cure, the polio vaccine effectively prevents the illness. Polio cases have decreased by over 99% since the Global Polio Eradication Initiative began in 1988.

## Highlights

1. Poliomyelitis has demonstrated a consistent epidemiological pattern in mainland China over the last decade, with no reported cases or deaths. <br/>
2. Incidence rate: The data provided from March 2014 to March 2024 displays a steady trend where the incidence of Poliomyelitis is zero. <br/>
3. Mortality rate: Similarly, there have been no recorded deaths related to Poliomyelitis during the specified timeframe. <br/>
4. The current situation as of March 2024, continues to show no recorded incidences or mortalities from Poliomyelitis. This suggests successful disease control and prevention methods in the region.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data reflects a consistent zero patient count across the years from 2014 to 2024, effectively indicating an absence of Poliomyelitis cases in mainland China. This result suggests that a sustained vaccination effort may be in place, given the disease's vaccine-preventable nature. It may also be a testament towards effective health policies working alongside a high immunization coverage, possibly reaching the WFHO target of 80% coverage. This shows that the mainland Chinese health system is successful in preventing Poliomyelitis.

### Deaths Analysis
In accordance to the case reports, the death rate stands at zero consistently from 2014 to 2024, corroborating the absence of polio cases in this period. This result underscores the efficacy of mainland China's disease control measures for Poliomyelitis. The absence of fatalities suggests a successful prevention of disease transmission and a stable health environment regarding Poliomyelitis in China's mainland, which is indicative of strong healthcare infrastructure and immunization programs.
