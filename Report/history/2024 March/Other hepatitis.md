## Introduction

Other hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver caused by infectious or non-infectious conditions not classified within the usual categories of viral hepatitis - Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. The predominant types of 'other hepatitis' include alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and drug-induced hepatitis. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, typically including jaundice, fatigue, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Long-term effects may lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer. Diagnosis usually involves liver function tests, blood tests, and imaging studies.

## Highlights

- There's a marked decrease in 'Other hepatitis' cases in mainland China from 3,199 in March 2014 to 587 in March 2024, showing effective disease control. <br/>
- Despite the decline in cases, deaths remain sporadic but low, indicating efficient disease management. <br/>
- A significant case drop in February 2020 (404 cases) could be COVID-19 impact. <br/>
- From 2022-2024, the disease shows a stable trend, suggesting it's currently under control and endemic.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Chinese mainland has consistently reported cases of Other hepatitis over the years from 2014 to 2024. Based on the data, there has been a clear decline in the number of cases reported. In March 2014, there were 3199 cases reported, the highest in the period under review. However, by March 2024, the cases had significantly declined to 587. This trend suggests that preventative measures, early diagnosis, improved treatment options, or a combination of these factors could be contributing to the decrease in Other hepatitis cases in the region.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths related to Other hepatitis in the Chinese mainland have displayed a relatively low occurrence over the observed decade. The highest number of monthly deaths was 4, reported in March 2014, and most months recorded 0 or 1 death. Notably, no month reported more than 2 deaths after July 2018, indicating an improved fatality rate against the disease. This could be due to better healthcare interventions, more effective treatments, or higher survival rates amongst patients diagnosed with Other hepatitis. Overall, the impact of the disease in terms of mortality appears to be reducing over time.
