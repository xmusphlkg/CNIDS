## Introduction

Diphtheria is a serious infectious disease caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae bacteria. Its primary symptom is a thick, gray coating in the throat or nose that can lead to difficulty in breathing. Other symptoms include fever, chills, and swollen glands. The bacteria produce a toxin that can damage the heart, nerves, and kidneys. It spreads through direct contact or contaminated objects. Vaccination is effective for prevention, and it's part of routine childhood immunizations. It is less common now, but remains significant in regions with low immunization coverage. Treatment typically involves antitoxins and antibiotics.

## Highlights

- Diphtheria cases have been extremely rare in mainland China, with data indicating isolated occurrences in 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, each reporting a single case. <br/>
- There have been no Diphtheria-associated fatalities reported from 2014 to the present day. <br/>
- Incidences of the disease appear to be sporadic and fatalities are absent, suggesting effective control measures. <br/>
- As of March 2024, mainland China reported zero new cases or deaths relating to Diphtheria.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis 
Over a decade, there have been limited reported cases of Diphtheria in the Chinese mainland; in total, six cases. The first case appeared in 2016, October after two years of zero reported cases starting from 2014. There were no new cases reported for almost two years until June 2018, another in 2020 (August and September), and the last two emerged in July of 2021 and June of 2023. It appears that instances of Diphtheria are extremely infrequent and isolated, implying that the disease might be efficiently controlled or rarely transmitted in the region. 

### Deaths Analysis 
Throughout the decade-long period from 2014 to 2024, there were no recorded deaths from Diphtheria in the Chinese mainland. The absence of fatalities could suggest a variety of things, such as effective treatment protocols or early detection of the illness. Despite a few recorded cases of the disease, 100% survival could indicate the successful implementation of public health interventions. It also may signal low severity in the presented cases. Therefore, from the standpoint of mortality, Diphtheria does not represent an urgent public health crisis in mainland China during this period.
