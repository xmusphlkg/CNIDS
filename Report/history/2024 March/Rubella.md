## Introduction

Rubella, commonly known as German measles, is a contagious disease caused by the Rubella virus. Symptoms include a distinctive red rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes, although many cases are asymptomatic. It primarily affects children and young adults and is typically a mild condition. However, infection during early pregnancy can result in severe complications, including congenital rubella syndrome, which can lead to developmental and sensory disabilities in babies. Vaccination has significantly decreased the occurrence of rubella globally.

## Highlights

- A considerable decrease in Rubella cases in Chinese mainland has been observed over the decade from 2014 to 2024. <br/>
- Data shows significant yearly fluctuations with peaks often occurring in Spring (March to May), possibly indicative of a seasonal pattern. <br/>
- Despite the overall decline in cases, a notable surge was observed in the first half of 2019, reaching nearly 10,000 cases in May. <br/>
- The fatality rate according to the data is extremely low, with only three recorded deaths in the past decade.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
A review of the Rubella case data for Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024 reveals a major outbreak in 2019, peaking with 9,095 cases reported in May. The data shows a general pattern of springtime peaks, likely due to increased congregation of people during these months. Over the nine years, there seems to be a steady decrease in the number of cases, possibly due to improved vaccination coverages and public health initiatives. In recent years, i.e., from 2020 onwards, the reported cases have remained below 300, indicating a more controlled situation. However, sporadic cases still occur, emphasizing the need for sustained immunization efforts.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the fluctuations in case numbers, Rubella-related death rates in Chinese mainland have remained remarkably low, with only three reported deaths over ten years. The first death occurred in March 2015 during a relatively mild surge of cases. The following two deaths occurred in June 2019 and March 2022, both coinciding with significant increases in reported cases. This pattern suggests a necessary link between disease prevalence and mortality, and underscores the importance of controlling case numbers to prevent Rubella-related deaths. It's also evidence of effective disease management, coupling preventive measures with adequate medical treatment of cases.
