Seasonal Patterns: The data reveals a clear seasonal pattern for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in Chinese mainland. The number of cases and deaths tends to reach its peak during the summer months, particularly in June and July, and then gradually decreases towards the end of the year. The fewest cases and deaths typically occur in January and February.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak period for AIDS cases and deaths in Chinese mainland occurs during the summer months of June and July. During these months, there is a significant increase in the number of cases and deaths compared to the rest of the year. On the other hand, the trough period, where the number of cases and deaths is at its lowest, is observed in January and February.

Overall Trends: When examining the overall trends of AIDS cases and deaths in Chinese mainland, there is a general upward trend in the number of cases and deaths from 2010 to 2018. However, after 2018, a fluctuating pattern emerges, with certain years showing higher numbers of cases and deaths compared to others. Importantly, it should be noted that the data for January and February 2013 indicates negative values for cases, which may be attributed to issues with data reporting.

Discussion: The observed seasonal patterns in AIDS cases and deaths in Chinese mainland imply a potential influence of environmental factors and social behaviors on disease transmission. The peak during the summer months might be linked to increased social activities and higher-risk behaviors, such as unprotected sexual contacts or intravenous drug use. The lower numbers during January and February could be a result of reduced social interaction during the winter months.

The rising trend in AIDS cases and deaths from 2010 to 2018 emphasizes the ongoing challenge of controlling and preventing the spread of the disease in Chinese mainland. It is crucial to continue implementing targeted public health interventions, including the promotion of safe sex practices, expanded access to HIV testing and counseling, and the provision of effective treatment and care for individuals living with HIV/AIDS.

However, the fluctuating pattern observed after 2018 calls for further investigation and analysis. Factors such as changes in surveillance systems, reporting practices, or differences in data collection methods might contribute to these fluctuations. Epidemiologists and public health authorities should closely monitor and evaluate the data to ensure accurate tracking of the disease burden and to inform effective prevention and control strategies.
