Seasonal Patterns:
Analysis of the provided data on monthly cases and deaths of Schistosomiasis in Chinese mainland before August 2023 reveals the presence of distinct seasonal patterns. Specifically, there is an evident peak in Schistosomiasis cases during the summer months of June, July, and August, followed by a decline towards the end of the year. Conversely, the winter months of December, January, and February generally exhibit the lowest number of cases.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for Schistosomiasis cases in Chinese mainland is consistently observed in July, closely followed by August, which consistently records a high number of reported cases. On the other hand, the trough period for cases occurs in December, extending through February, during which the number of reported cases is at its lowest.

Overall Trends:
Analysis of the data reveals an overall declining trend in the number of Schistosomiasis cases reported in Chinese mainland over the years. While the number of cases appeared to fluctuate in the early years (2010-2011), a more consistent decline has been observed from 2012 onwards. Similarly, the number of deaths related to Schistosomiasis has consistently remained low throughout the entire study period, with only sporadic occurrences reported.

Discussion:
The presence of observed seasonal patterns suggests that Schistosomiasis transmission in Chinese mainland is influenced by climatic factors. In particular, higher temperatures and increased water activities during the summer create favorable conditions for the transmission of the parasite. The peak period of cases during the summer aligns with the traditional peak season for Schistosomiasis transmission in other endemic regions. The overall declining trend in cases over the years indicates the efficacy of ongoing disease control efforts, such as preventive measures, public health campaigns, and snail control programs, in reducing the incidence of Schistosomiasis in Chinese mainland. However, it is crucial to maintain vigilance and continue implementing effective control strategies to further reduce the burden of this disease on the population.
