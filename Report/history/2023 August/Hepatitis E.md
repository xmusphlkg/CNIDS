Discussion:
The observed seasonal pattern for Hepatitis E cases in Chinese mainland, with peak periods during the spring and summer months, is consistent with the known features of the virus. Hepatitis E is mainly transmitted through the consumption of contaminated water or food, with warmer weather facilitating the growth and survival of the virus in the environment.

Various factors could influence fluctuations in the number of cases from year to year, including surveillance and reporting practices, population susceptibility, and variations in environmental conditions. Hence, public health authorities must closely track these trends and implement appropriate preventive measures, such as improving water and food safety, to alleviate the burden of Hepatitis E in Chinese mainland.
