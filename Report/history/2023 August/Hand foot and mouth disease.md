Seasonal Patterns: Based on the available data, it is evident that Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in mainland China exhibits a distinct seasonal pattern. The incidence of cases tends to rise during the spring and summer months and decline during the fall and winter months. This pattern remains consistent throughout the years examined.

Peak and Trough Periods: The peak periods for HFMD cases in mainland China are typically observed from May to August, with the highest number of cases occurring during these months. The trough periods, characterized by the lowest number of cases, are usually seen from December to February.

Overall Trends: Analyzing the overall trends, there is an upward trend in the number of HFMD cases from 2010 to 2015, with a significant surge in cases during this period. However, after 2015, the number of cases appears to stabilize and fluctuate at a relatively high level. The data from 2020 onwards demonstrates a significant decrease in cases, likely attributable to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated preventive measures.

Discussion: The seasonal pattern of HFMD in mainland China aligns with the recognized characteristics of the disease. It tends to peak during warmer months when conditions are more conducive to the transmission of enteroviruses that cause the disease. The higher incidence during the summer months can be attributed to increased social interactions, particularly in schools and daycare centers, where the disease is more easily transmitted among young children.

The increasing trend in HFMD cases observed from 2010 to 2015 may be attributable to various factors. These include changes in reporting and surveillance systems, heightened awareness and diagnosis, as well as potential shifts in the dominant circulating strains of enteroviruses during that period.

The decline in cases since 2020 can be largely attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted the implementation of stringent public health measures, encompassing social distancing, hand hygiene, and school closures. These measures also helped reduce the transmission of HFMD. It is crucial to monitor future trends and continue implementing preventive measures to further alleviate the burden of HFMD in mainland China.
