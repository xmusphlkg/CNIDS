Seasonal Patterns: 
Based on the provided data, a consistent seasonal pattern is evident in the number of cases of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever in mainland China. The number of cases tends to be higher during September to December, with a peak in November. From January to August, the number of cases generally decreases and reaches its lowest point in August. This pattern is observed consistently across multiple years, indicating a seasonal trend.

Peak and Trough Periods: 
Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever cases in mainland China reach their peak in November, with the highest number of reported cases occurring during this month. The lowest number of cases, on the other hand, is observed in August. These peak and trough periods remain consistent over multiple years, suggesting a recurring pattern.

Overall Trends: 
The number of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever cases in mainland China has displayed an upward trend from 2010 to 2023. There are fluctuations in the number of cases from year to year, but a general increase can be observed. However, it is important to note that there was a sudden decrease in reported cases in 2013, with negative values recorded for January and February. This decrease may be attributed to data reporting issues or other factors that affected the accuracy of the data during that period.

Discussion: 
The observed seasonal patterns in the data indicate that certain environmental or climatic factors may contribute to the spread of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever in mainland China. The higher number of cases during September to December could be influenced by factors such as increased human activity, changes in weather conditions, or the presence of vectors that transmit the disease.

The consistent peak in November suggests that this month provides favorable conditions for disease transmission. Public health authorities should prioritize preventive measures and surveillance during this period to effectively control the spread of the disease.

The overall increasing trend in the number of cases over the years emphasizes the need for ongoing efforts in disease surveillance, prevention, and control. It is crucial to identify the underlying factors contributing to this increase and implement appropriate interventions to mitigate the impact of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever in mainland China.

It is important to note that the sudden decrease in reported cases in 2013 raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of the data during that period. Further investigation and verification of the data are necessary to ensure the validity of the findings.

Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights into the seasonal patterns, peak and trough periods, and overall trends of Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever in mainland China. Further research and analysis are required to gain a better understanding of the factors driving these observed patterns and to inform effective public health interventions.
## Introduction

Epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) is a group of illnesses caused by several distinct families of viruses. The conditions are characterized by an acute onset of high fever and bleeding disorders, which can lead to shock, organ failure, and potentially death. Rodents often serve as reservoir hosts for these viruses, and human infection typically occurs through contact with the animals or their excretions. The term encompasses various regional diseases, such as Ebola, Dengue, Yellow fever, and Hantavirus, each with its distinct etiology but similar clinical presentations. Control measures focus on prevention, supportive care, and occasionally, antiviral treatments.

## Highlights

- The number of cases of Epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF) has fluctuated from 2010 to 2023, with notable peaks occurring almost annually around November; however, the overall trend suggests a decline in both cases and deaths in the most recent years (2021-2023). <br/>
- The fatality rate has varied considerably over the years, with September 2012 being an outlier with 150 deaths. Generally, the fatality rate has been relatively low, especially in the period from 2018 onwards. <br/>
- Seasonal patterns in EHF cases can be seen, with cases generally increasing from May to November and then declining through the winter months, which is consistent with patterns of rodent-borne diseases due to factors such as human-rodent contact and rodent population dynamics. <br/>
- The most recent data from October 2023 shows 439 cases and 3 deaths, indicating a contained situation compared to historical peaks, but constant monitoring is essential to prevent and control future outbreaks. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Epidemic hemorrhagic fever in mainland China from 2010 to 2023 displays seasonality with peaks generally in the warmer months, indicating possible vector or host population surges. The highest number of cases was observed in November 2012, with a total of 3000 reported cases. Over the years, there is no conclusive trend indicating either a significant increase or decrease in the number of cases. Notable fluctuations are evident during specific months, which may suggest changes in environmental factors, disease surveillance intensity, or reporting accuracy.

### Deaths Analysis
The fatality data associated with epidemic hemorrhagic fever from 2010 to 2023 in China shows variability with a noteworthy peak in September 2012, reporting 150 deaths. Following this peak, the deaths per month have not reached similar levels. December tends to show comparatively higher numbers, possibly due to cumulative effects of infections in autumn. The mortality rate fluctuates, making it difficult to discern a clear trend over the years; however, 2012 stands out as an anomalous year with the highest reported deaths.
