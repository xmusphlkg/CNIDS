## Introduction

Other Hepatitis refers to inflammation of the liver caused by varied strains of hepatitis viruses not explicitly categorised under the commonly known forms (A, B, C, D, E). This includes, but is not limited to, hepatitis F and G, or those caused due to autoimmune conditions or medication-induced. It may result in either acute or chronic infections leading to serious liver damage, liver failure or even cancer. Proper diagnosis and treatment are vital, but prevention through safe practices and immunisation remains key in controlling these diseases.

## Highlights

- The data exhibits a marked reduction in Other Hepatitis cases in China from 3106 in April 2014 to 572 in April 2024, with significant decline in 2020.<br/>
- Despite this decrease, deaths remained usually zero or one monthly, suggesting improved disease management. <br/>
- Exceptional spikes are observed in 2023, but by April 2024, both cases and deaths are comparatively minimal, indicating effective containment. <br/>
- The disease trend suggests a steady progression towards eradication, but continuous vigilance is needed. 


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of other hepatitis in mainland China show a general pattern of decrease from April 2014 to April 2024. Starting from 3106 cases in April 2014, the numbers show variability but with an overall downward trend, dipping below 1000 cases/month in 2020, 656 cases in 2022, and reaching as low as 347 cases in December 2022. However, despite occasional rises such as in March 2023 with 722 cases, the numbers remain significantly lower than in earlier years, demonstrating some success in controlling the disease.

### Deaths Analysis
Reported deaths from other hepatitis over the same period are low and relatively stable, usually amounting to 0 or 1 per month, with 2 at the maximum. The only exceptions are in June 2018 and December 2019, where 2 deaths were reported. The highest annual death count is 8 in 2016. There is no noticeable trend in death counts, possibly due to the generally low figures. Overall, the lethality of the disease in reported cases is very low over the 10-year period.
