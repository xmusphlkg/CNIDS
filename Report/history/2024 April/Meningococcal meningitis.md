## Introduction

Meningococcal meningitis is a severe bacterial infection of the membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord, known as the meninges. It's caused by the Neisseria meningitidis bacterium. The disease is associated with high mortality rates and serious health complications among survivors. It spreads mainly through respiratory droplets or close contact, often causing outbreaks in crowded conditions. Although it can occur at any age, it primarily affects infants, adolescents, and young adults. Its symptoms include fever, headache, and a stiff neck. Vaccination provides the most effective prevention.

## Highlights

1. There has been a significant decrease in reported Meningococcal meningitis cases in China since 2014, with no upward trend observed.<br/>
2. The mortality rate due to Meningococcal meningitis has also decreased, with fewer deaths reported since 2017.<br/>
3. There was a dramatic reduction in cases and deaths in 2020 which continues till 2024, indicating effective control measures may have been implemented.<br/>
4. Monthly case count and deaths vary throughout the years, but cases typically seem higher in the first half of the year.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported Meningococcal meningitis cases in the Chinese mainland exhibit a vaguely cyclical pattern, with lower case counts during certain periods. The highest cases occurred in 2014 with an average of 15 cases per month. Following this, there was a gradual decline in the yearly case average to 9 cases by 2021. However, towards the end of the data in April 2024, an upward trend in reported cases is noticeable, suggesting a potential resurgence of the disease. It's also worth noting the drop in reported cases during the first half of 2020, probably due to the COVID-19 pandemic disruptions.

### Deaths Analysis
The death count from Meningococcal meningitis, although relatively low, follows a similar cyclical pattern to the cases but with a lesser degree of correlation. The peak death count observed is 6 in December 2017 and is not noticeably tied to the highest case numbers. Deaths, on average, declined significantly from 2015 onward, suggesting improved treatment or prevention methods. Strikingly, zero deaths are reported onwards from December 2023, indicating significant advancements in handling the disease despite the slight increase in case numbers.
