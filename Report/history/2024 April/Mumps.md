## Introduction

Mumps is a highly contagious viral illness, characterized by the swelling of salivary glands. Early symptoms often include fever, body aches, fatigue, and loss of appetite. The disease primarily spreads through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person. The Mumps, Measles, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine is used as a preventive measure against this illness. Complications can include infections of the brain, or inflammation of the ovaries or breasts in females and testicles in males. Higher risk is observed in unvaccinated populations or crowded environments.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between 2014 and 2024, reported cases of mumps in China mainland ranged from 3344 to 37913 cases per month, showing a seasonal trend with peak cases often appearing in spring and summer months. Notably, there were sharp declines in reported mumps cases beginning in 2020 and extending into 2021, likely attributable to measures such as quarantine and social distancing enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, despite fluctuations, there has been a declining trend in the reporting of mumps cases in recent years.

### Deaths Analysis
The deaths due to mumps from 2014 to 2024 were sporadic and relatively rare, with a monthly total ranging from 0 to 4. The total deaths occurred more frequently in colder months, namely January, February, and December, although these occurrences were not consistent each year. The highest number of deaths was reported in January 2020 with a total of 4 fatalities. However, with only a handful of deaths over a ten-year span, it is clear that although mumps is prevalent, it is not typically fatal within the Chinese mainland population.
