## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infection primarily affecting the lungs, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It's spread through airborne droplets when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. TB can also impact other organs and is distinguished by symptoms like prolonged cough, weight loss, fever, and night sweats. Despite it being a preventable and curable disease, TB remains a significant global health issue, affecting millions of individuals annually. Early detection and immediate treatment are crucial to control its spread.

## Highlights

- A steady downward trend in Tuberculosis cases was observed from 118,849 cases in April 2014 to 68,732 cases in April 2024, signifying successful control measures.<br/>
- Contrarily, an upward trend was noted in deaths, from 183 in April 2014 to 319 in April 2024, indicating the need for improved medical strategies.<br/>
- Seasonal trends with case peaks typically seen in March each year suggest a possible pattern of disease spread.<br/>
- A significant case and death reduction in February 2020 could be tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The number of Tuberculosis cases in mainland China shows a declining trend from 2014 to 2024. In 2014, the reported cases were over 100,000 throughout the year with the highest being recorded in April (118,849). However, by 2024, the cases were fluctuating around 70,000 with the highest being in March (70,013). Despite the slight rise typically seen at the start of each year, the general pattern has been a steady decrease. The drastic drop in February 2020 could be attributed to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic which might have overshadowed TB cases.

### Deaths Analysis
Unlike the number of cases reported, the number of deaths due to Tuberculosis in mainland China has shown a slight increasing trend from 2014 to 2024. In 2014, deaths rarely rose above 150 per month, but in 2024, reported deaths were consistently over 200 per month, with the highest recorded in December (416). Even though there's a decrease of TB cases, the increase in the number of deaths suggests a possible need for improved TB treatment and care in mainland China.
