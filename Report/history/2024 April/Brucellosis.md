## Introduction

Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacterial genus Brucella. It primarily affects animals like cattle, goats, pigs, and dogs, but humans can contract the illness through the consumption of contaminated animal products or direct contact with infected animals. Its symptoms in humans include fever, fatigue, joint pain, and sweating. Brucellosis is a significant public health issue worldwide, especially in rural, agricultural regions. The disease can be prevented through the consumption of pasteurized dairy products and use of personal protective equipment in high-risk activities.

## Highlights

- There's been an overall increasing trend in the number of Brucellosis cases in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024. <br/>
- Peak case numbers typically occur around mid-year (June-July), hinting at a possible seasonal pattern to the disease transmission.<br/>
- Despite the rise in case numbers, the number of fatalities remains extremely low, showing that while Brucellosis is becoming more common, it is not highly lethal.<br/>
- Recent data indicates that cases continue to rise, with 7141 cases reported in April 2024, showing the disease situation remains a concern.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The trend of Brucellosis cases in China Mainland generally follows a seasonal pattern, with the highest numbers reported from April to September each year. This cyclical trend could possibly be related to the breeding seasons of certain livestock, from which Brucellosis is often contracted. The cases start to climb around March or April, peak around June or July, and then decline towards the end of the year. Additionally, a gradual yet significant increase in the number of cases over the years from 2014 to 2024 can be observed, indicating an expanding prevalence of the disease. 

### Deaths Analysis
The total number of reported deaths due to Brucellosis has remained low throughout the years despite rising case numbers. This suggests that while Brucellosis infections have increased, it does not often result in death and perhaps is effectively managed or treated. Deaths do not follow a clear pattern or trend and appear sporadic. However, the exact reason for sporadic deaths is unclear without further information on individual cases, patient's health conditions, and treatment specifics.  It is also noteworthy that there seems to be no correlation between the number of cases and deaths in a particular month or period.
