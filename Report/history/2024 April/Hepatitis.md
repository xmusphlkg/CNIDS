## Introduction

Hepatitis is an inflammatory condition of the liver, commonly caused by viral infections but can also stem from toxins or an auto-immune process. There are five types - A, B, C, D, and E. Each one differs in the method of transmission and impacts on health. Though some types can lead to chronic diseases or even liver cancer, vaccines for hepatitis A and B aid in prevention. It's critical to practice good hygiene and safe practices to avoid spread.

## Highlights

- There is a general increasing trend in both Hepatitis cases and deaths in Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, which suggests active transmission and high lethality. <br/>
- An unusual spike observed in deaths from Hepatitis in mid-2023 remains consistent in subsequent months, requiring thorough investigation and comprehensive surveillance to understand underlying factors. <br/>
- Despite some slight fluctuations, the number of cases seems to peak during the summer months (June, July, August), signalling possible seasonal patterns. <br/>
- A significant increase in cases was observed in March 2024, marking the highest monthly incidence in the given data, which could signal a worsening situation.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The Hepatitis cases in mainland China between 2014 and 2024 demonstrated an upward trend with some seasonality, with cases peaking in March before declining and then surging again in July. It's notable that there was a temporary significant drop in cases in February 2020, correlating with the outbreak of COVID-19 which might have impacted reporting and diagnosis resources. In the final three years (2022-2024), the data shows an unusual surge in cases with the highest recorded in August 2023. 

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths caused by Hepatitis remained relatively constant from 2014 until 2020, averaging around 50 per month. However, a significant increase in fatalities was observed from late-2023 onwards, peaking at 428 in December 2023. This sharp rise suggests a possible change in the virulence of the disease, public health measures, or reporting standards. A exceptional high peak was observed in April 2024 with 231 deaths. It's crucial to investigate these sudden changes to assess whether it's an isolated event or a substantial long-term trend.
