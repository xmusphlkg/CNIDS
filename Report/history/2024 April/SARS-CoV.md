## Introduction

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a viral strain that initially surfaced in 2002 in Guangdong, China. It belongs to the coronavirus family, known to cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. SARS-CoV is zoonotic, crossing from animals to humans. It is responsible for the highly infectious disease, SARS, marked by severe respiratory illness, fever, cough, and pneumonia. Notable for high infection rates, SARS-CoV prompted a global epidemic in 2003, infecting over 8,000 and causing 774 deaths worldwide.

## Highlights

1. SARS-CoV has shown a consistent absence of cases in Mainland China from April 2014 to April 2024 with no reported infections.<br/>
2. Mortality related to SARS-CoV in the same period is also at zero, indicating no recorded deaths from the virus.<br/>
3. With this data, the situation of SARS-CoV in Mainland China can be characterized as being under complete control.<br/>
4. There are no apparent seasonal trends or sudden spikes, suggesting effective long-term containment and prevention measures in place.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Since April 2014 throughout April 2024, there was a consistent trend of zero reported cases of SARS-CoV in the mainland of China. This indicates a total absence of SARS-CoV or possible underreporting over the ten-year period. The absence of reported cases suggests that an effective preventive mechanism might be in place, possibly reflecting a well-implemented surveillance and control system, and effective public health interventions.

### Deaths Analysis
Similarly, in the ten year period from April 2014 through April 2024, there were zero reported deaths due to SARS-CoV in mainland China. This absence of SARS-CoV related fatalities demonstrates that either the infection was completely controlled, or mortality related to any potential infection was successfully managed. This absence of death may also be attributable to effective clinical management strategies and comprehensive public health measures in place.
