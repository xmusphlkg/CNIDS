## Introduction

Anthrax is a severe and potentially fatal disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a spore-forming bacterium. It primarily affects livestock and wild game, but humans can get infected through exposure to infected animals or their products. Anthrax comes in three forms: cutaneous (skin), inhalation (lungs), and gastrointestinal (digestive system). Cutaneous is the most common and least deadly, whereas inhalation anthrax is the most lethal. Anthrax is not contagious but it is a potential biological weapon due to the longevity and survivability of its spores.

## Highlights

- A clear seasonal trend exists, with Anthrax case peaks in China's warm months (June to September).<br/>
- Case numbers fluctuate; an increase is seen in August, peaking at 123 in August 2023.<br/>
- Deaths are low suggesting a low case-fatality rate, with sporadic fatalities like the two in August 2022.<br/>
- As of April 2024, the situation is stable with 20 cases, no deaths, but previous trends suggest a possible summer increase.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Anthrax cases in Chinese mainland indicates a recurring pattern of its seasonal peak in the summer months (June to August), with the highest number of cases occurring in August 2023 (123 cases). There appears to be a general increase in annual cases, with marked surges seen in 2016, 2018, 2021, and 2023. The least number of monthly cases were consistently reported during the winter months (December to February). The actual reasons for these patterns need further investigation, although climatic factors, animal host cycles and human activities may play major roles.

### Deaths Analysis
The data on Anthrax-related deaths in the Chinese mainland presents an infrequent occurrence. Most months reported zero deaths, despite the varying number of cases. The highest number of deaths occurred sporadically with a maximum of two in a month (August 2014, August 2016, June 2017, December 2017, August 2018, August 2021, August 2022, and September 2023). Surprisingly, these deaths are not necessarily concurrent with the highest case numbers, suggesting successful intervention measures or varying pathogen virulence. The trends point to a relatively low case fatality rate for Anthrax during this period.
