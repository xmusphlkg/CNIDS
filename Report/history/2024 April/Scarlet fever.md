## Introduction

Scarlet fever, also known as scarlatina, is an infectious bacterial disease affecting mostly children. It is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). Symptoms include high fever, sore throat, red rashes on the body, and a characteristic red 'strawberry' tongue. It was once a dangerous illness but is now easily treatable with antibiotics. The disease spreads through respiratory droplets in a manner similar to the common cold or the flu. Consequently, strict personal hygiene is highly advocated for prevention.

## Highlights

- Scarlet Fever cases in China fluctuate seasonally, peaking between April-July and decreasing by year-end.<br/>
- An alarming upward trend is visible from 2021, heightening in late 2023 and early 2024.<br/>
- Despite disease fluctuations, only two deaths were reported since 2014, indicating a low fatality rate.<br/>
- April 2024 records 6125 cases, reflecting the usual yearly peak but also continuing the recent concerning trend.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The cumulative data from 2014 through 2024 show a consistent cyclical pattern in reported cases of Scarlet fever on the Chinese mainland. The disease typically reaches a peak around May to June each year, followed by a substantial decrease towards the end of the year, likely reflecting seasonal variations in disease prevalence. A dramatic decrease in cases was observed in 2020, possibly due to public health measures elicited by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, overall, there has been an upward trend in case numbers, most notably in each December since 2018. 

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the significant number of reported cases over the studied period, the mortality rate due to Scarlet fever remained remarkably low. Only three deaths were reported between 2014-2024, occurring in April 2015, January 2020, and September 2020. This corresponds to an extremely low case-fatality rate, which could be attributed to effective public health interventions, medical treatments and possibly earlier detection of the disease. Despite the low fatality rate, the significant incidence of the disease over time calls for continued surveillance and preventative measures.
