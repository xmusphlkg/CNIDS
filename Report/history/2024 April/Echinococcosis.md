## Introduction

Echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, is a parasitic infection caused by Echinococcus tapeworms. The disease occurs worldwide, primarily affecting livestock and humans. It is transmitted by the ingestion of Echinococcus eggs through contaminated food, water or direct contact with an infected animal. The infection often results in cysts in organs like the liver and lungs, causing various symptoms including abdominal pain, cough and chest discomfort. Echinococcosis can be lethal if untreated, requiring surgery or long-term drug therapy for management.

## Highlights

- There's a substantial increase in Echinococcosis cases over the years, peaking in 2017 (1077 cases), and again in 2024 with 534 cases by March.<br/>
- A significant drop in case numbers starts from 2022, hitting the lowest in November (97 cases).<br/>
- Despite variations in case numbers, fatalities stay low, hinting at an efficient disease management system.<br/>
- As of April 2024, case numbers are rising, though the lack of future data prevents trend confirmation.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Echinococcosis in mainland China appear to fluctuate monthly over this 10-year period, with no discernable seasonal trends. Dramatic peaks appear in March 2017, November 2016, and March 2024 with 1077, 639, and 534 cases respectively, while the lowest values occur in November and December 2022 with only 97 and 144 cases. Data suggests a possible downward trend from 2017 through to the end of 2022, followed by an increase in 2023 and 2024. 

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths from Echinococcosis are remarkably low despite the fluctuation in cases, with only 8 deaths reported over the 10-year period. 2015, 2016, 2019, and 2020 each saw 1 reported death, while 2019 had the highest annual death count of 2. Most months recorded zero deaths, indicating a high survival rate, probably due to effective treatment interventions despite variations in case numbers.
