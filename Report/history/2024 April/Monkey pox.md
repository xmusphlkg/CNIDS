## Introduction

Monkeypox is a rare viral zoonosis endemic in Central and West African countries, caused by the Monkeypox virus. It closely resembles human smallpox and is transmitted to humans from animals, primarily rodents and monkeys. Human-to-human transmission can occur, albeit less commonly. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, rash, and chills. The disease typically self-resolves within weeks, but severe and sometimes fatal complications can occur, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems. There is currently no specific treatment for monkeypox.

## Highlights

1. Declining trend: Monkey pox cases have significantly declined from September 2023 till April 2024, with a noticeable decrease from 80 to 39 incidences. <br/>
2. Mortality rate: The data suggests a zero mortality rate for the given time period. No death has been reported due to Monkey pox. <br/>
3. Peak in October 2023: The disease exhibited a peak in October 2023 with 127 reported cases. <br/>
4. Sustainable reduction: The past few months have shown a sustainable reduction of cases, from 102 in December 2023 to 39 in April 2024.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Between September 2023 and April 2024, mainland China reported a decrease in the number of Monkey pox cases. The peak of the epidemic was observed in October 2023 with 127 reported cases. From October, intermittent declines were experienced, except in December when a slight rise to 102 cases occurred. From January 2024 to April 2024, there was a steady decline of cases, from 97 to 39. This could likely have resulted from efficient containment measures or increased herd immunity. (Word count: 77)

### Deaths Analysis
Interestingly, despite the fluctuation of reported Monkey pox cases from September 2023 to April 2024, there were zero recorded fatalities. This indicates either a non-lethal strain of the virus or effective medical treatment. This zero-mortality level could also be due to early detection and intervention, adequate access to healthcare facilities, adherence to prescribed treatment regimens by the patients, or a combination of these factors. This forms a basis for further study on potential strain variations and case management strategies. (Word count: 82)
