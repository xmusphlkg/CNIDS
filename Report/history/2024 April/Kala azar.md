## Introduction

Kala azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis, is a parasitic disease transmitted through the bite of infected female sandflies. Caused by the Leishmania parasite, the disease primarily attacks the internal organs, such as the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Its symptoms include fever, weight loss, anemia, and an enlarged spleen or liver. Without prompt and effective treatment, Kala azar is typically fatal. Predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions, the World Health Organization has identified it as a neglected tropical disease.

## Highlights

- Kala azar's incidence in mainland China shows fluctuating trends, rising during certain months and subsiding during others. There's no consistent pattern of transmission.<br/>
- The fatal cases of Kala azar is minimal compared to the incidence. Only 8 deaths have been recorded from 2014 to 2024, indicating effective case management and treatment protocol.<br/>
- The disease burden increased significantly in October and November 2015 but then normalized again and has been steady in recent years.<br/>
- As of April 2024, the number of Kala azar cases reported is 33 and no deaths have been recorded, showing a similar trend to previous years.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Kala azar cases in the Chinese mainland showed a fluctuating trend from 2014 to 2024. The highest caseload was observed in November 2015 with 123 cases, whereas the lowest coincided with November 2017 possessing only 8 cases. Dramatic case surges, in a pattern, were noticeable in autumn months, particularly in October and November. Overall, the case trend did not show a steadily increasing or decreasing pattern, indicating the disease's intermittent nature, possibly due to varying weather conditions, vector proliferation, and disease control activities.

### Deaths Analysis
Overall, Kala azar exhibited a very low fatality rate in this reported span, with only seven deaths recorded across the entire period. While most months reported no Kala azar-associated deaths, there were isolated instances of single fatalities in May 2014, February 2016, November 2020, February 2022, April 2023, August 2023, and October 2023. This scattered fatality data suggests an effective clinical management protocol for the disease, consisting of early detection and prompt treatment. It's worth noting that a change in the available treatment approaches or overall disease management efforts could significantly shift this trend.
