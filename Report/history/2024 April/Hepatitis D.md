## Introduction

Hepatitis D, also known as Delta Hepatitis, is a serious liver disease caused by the Hepatitis D virus (HDV). HDV is contracted through direct contact with infected blood. It's a unique virus because it can only infect people already infected with Hepatitis B, leading to a co-infection or a superinfection. It can cause severe symptoms and complications, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. Vaccination for Hepatitis B can provide protection against Hepatitis D as well.

## Highlights

- Significant decrease in Hepatitis D cases in mainland China over 8 years, with a peak of 60 cases in January 2016 to less than one-third of that, 17 cases in April 2024. <br/>
- Despite variations in monthly cases, a downward trend is consistent throughout the years. <br/>
- Zero fatality from Hepatitis D throughout this period suggesting the disease may have been effectively managed with healthcare interventions. <br/>
- Lower case numbers in recent years indicate improved prevention/control measures, early diagnosis and treatment of Hepatitis D.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data of Hepatitis D cases in Chinese mainland shows a decreasing trend from 2016 to 2024. Initially in 2016, cases often exceed 40 per month and sometimes over 50. However, by 2024 the figures consistently fall below 30. It is clearly evident that the measures to control and prevent Hepatitis D have been effective, resulting in fewer cases each year. There seems to be no apparent seasonal effect discernible from the data. The effort should continue to sustain the downward trend as part of the epidemiological strategy to eradicate Hepatitis D in the long term.

### Deaths Analysis
Strikingly, over the years from 2016 to 2024, there have been no Hepatitis D related mortalities in the Chinese mainland, as per the data. This data might suggest effective disease management and healthcare facilities, leading to zero fatality rate. However, it's vital to remain cautious as the data might also represent under-reporting. It is recommended to ensure robust monitoring mechanisms to accurately report and manage Hepatitis D mortality rates. The continued absence of fatalities indicates successful interventions but should be maintained through ongoing public health initiatives.
