## Introduction

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It progresses in four distinct stages: primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. Symptoms vary with each stage, starting from sores and rashes in the early phases to serious organ damage in the later stages. Additionally, a special form, congenital syphilis, can be passed from pregnant women to their fetus. Syphilis is typically diagnosed via blood tests and can be effectively treated with antibiotics, specifically penicillin. It's crucial to detect and treat syphilis early to prevent its severe consequences.


## Highlights

- Syphilis cases in mainland China show a cyclical annual trend, often peaking from March to August and decreasing from December to February.<br/>
- There is upward trend in reported cases from 2014 to 2024, highlighting an escalating disease situation. Rapid growth is noted from 2023.<br/>
- Despite rising case numbers, Syphilis-related deaths remain relatively low and stable, suggesting improved diagnosis and treatment.<br/>
- As of April 2024, there are 61,511 reported cases and 4 deaths, continuing the trend of high cases and low mortality.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
An analysis of the data over the past ten years reveals a cyclical trend in reported cases of Syphilis on the Chinese mainland. Generally, each year sees a dip in reported cases during the winter months (December and January), followed by a sharp increase as spring begins in March. The numbers remain comparatively high during the summer months, hitting a peak in August. An overall progressive increase in the number of reported cases can be seen each year, with highest being recorded in August 2023 (61,068 cases). This indicates a rising trend in the incidence of syphilis.

### Deaths Analysis
The reported deaths due to Syphilis demonstrate a generally very low mortality rate, staying in the single digits in most months. The deaths peak slightly in some summer months, which could coincide with the infection peaks. However, the correlation is not strongly consistent across the years. The highest number of deaths occurred in January 2020, with 25 reported deaths. Despite the increase in reported cases across the years, there's not a similar progressive increase in deaths, indicating effective management and treatment strategies for the disease.
