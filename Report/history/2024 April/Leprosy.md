## Introduction

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. The disease primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, and mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract. Leprosy is characterized by skin lesions and progressive nerve damage, which may lead to disability. It is transmitted through droplets from the nose and mouth during close, frequent contact with untreated cases. Leprosy has a long incubation period, often manifesting 2-10 years after exposure and it can be effectively treated using multi-drug therapy.

## Highlights

- The number of reported leprosy cases in the Chinese mainland has significantly decreased over the decade, from 85 cases in April 2014 to 43 cases in April 2024.<br/>
- A clear pattern emerges where leprosy cases seem to surge during spring (March-April), though the magnitude of this peak decelerates over the years.<br/>
- Leprosy-related death incidents are very rare, with only 3 recorded fatalities during the 2016-2021 period.<br/>
- Despite the overall decline, there is a modest upward trend of cases in early 2024, indicating the need for sustained public health vigilance.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, the reported Leprosy cases in mainland China have exhibited a general decrease. Initial cases reported in April 2014 were 85, hitting the highest peak at 108 in March 2016. Subsequently, the case numbers have gradually decreased over the years. Sporadic upsurges in cases are observable during early spring (March-April) and mid-summer (June-July), possibly due to climate or seasonal factors affecting the disease transmission. By 2024, the overall reduction signifies a probable effective containment and prevention strategy against the disease, highlighting the importance of early detection, rapid response, and suitable interventions.

### Deaths Analysis
The mortality rate for Leprosy in mainland China from 2014 to 2024 remains relatively low, with only three documented deaths throughout the decade. The first death occurred in January 2016, followed by a second in August 2019, then a third in December 2021. No pattern can be discerned from the deathsâ€™ distribution across the months and years. This minor mortality rate may attribute to China's efficient healthcare system detecting and managing Leprosy cases promptly. However, continuous monitoring is crucial as Leprosy often leads to severe disabilities if not treated early, which impacts quality of life rather than causing death.
