## Introduction

Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection typically affecting the mucous membranes of the nose and throat. The disease is caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae and is primarily spread through person-to-person contact and respiratory droplets. Symptoms typically manifest as a thick, gray membrane covering the throat and tonsils, sore throat, fever, and swollen glands. If left untreated, Diphtheria can cause severe complications, such as damage to the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. Vaccination is a primary strategy for prevention.

## Highlights

- Diphtheria is remarkably under control in China, as evidenced by the consistently low number of cases over the past decade. <br/>
- There has been no significant outbreak, with an occasional single case reported intermittently from October 2016-like in June 2018, August and September 2020, July 2021, July 2022, June 2023. <br/>
- Mortality due to Diphtheria is remarkably low to non-existent, as no deaths have been recorded in the past decade. <br/>
- As of April 2024, there have been no new cases or deaths attributed to Diphtheria, indicating an effective control and prevention framework in place.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From April 2014 to April 2024, the mainland of China has maintained a remarkably low prevalence of diphtheria, with the reported cases cluster around single-digit numbers sporadically across the years. The recorded cases per year represented about one case per year for 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The ubiquitous zero-count over the said period exhibits the effectiveness of the implemented public health measures. Despite being an airborne disease, such low transmission rate over a decade mirrors high vaccination coverage and adequate sensitization. However, the scattered presence across different years implies the need for continuous monitoring. (Word count: 110)

### Deaths Analysis
Over a ten-year span from April 2014 to April 2024, there was no reported fatality due to diphtheria in Chinese mainland, suggesting an excellent disease management protocol. This low fatality rate possibly depicts quick identification, sufficient healthcare resources, and effective treatment methods. Moreover, the high coverage of diphtheria vaccination and health literacy could also have contributed to this. Nonetheless, the persistent incidence of cases and a theoretical potential for mortality necessitates ongoing surveillance and adherence to preventive measures. Altogether, the death data emphasize the efficiency of Chinese healthcare in responding to diphtheria. (Word count: 100)
