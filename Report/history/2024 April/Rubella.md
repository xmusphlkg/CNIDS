## Introduction

Rubella, commonly known as German measles, is a contagious viral infection best known for its mild distinctive red rash. The rubella virus, spread mostly through airborne droplets from the nose or throat, typically affects children, causing symptoms like fever and headache. Though usually mild in children and adults, Rubella can pose severe risks to unborn babies when expecting mothers contract the virus, particularly during the first trimester, potentially causing congenital rubella syndrome, which can lead to heart defects, loss of hearing and eyesight, and other lifelong conditions.


## Highlights

- There's a significant decline in Rubella cases in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024, with a peak of 9095 cases in May 2019 reducing to around 33-68 cases in early 2024.<br/>
- Periodic spikes are present, but the overall ten-year trend shows a consistent decrease in reported cases.<br/>
- Mortality rate remains low, with only two deaths over the ten-year period, indicating Rubella's low lethality.<br/>
- As of April 2024, Rubella appears to be better managed within Chinese mainland, with just 68 cases.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The incidence of Rubella in mainland China has seen a steady decline between 2014 and 2024. There were significant seasonal variations, with peaks usually seen during spring (April-May). For instance, the highest peak was recorded in May 2019 with 9095 cases. Post-2019, there was a noticeable decline, with cases often not exceeding the mid-hundreds. This suggests effective control measures, possibly enhanced vaccination programs, have been taken into effect since the 2019 peak.

### Deaths Analysis
The death statistics indicate that Rubella had a low mortality rate in mainland China between 2014 and 2024. Only three deaths were reported during the entire period: one in March 2015, one in June 2019, and one in March 2022. These isolated incidences of fatalities could be due to factors such as poor health infrastructure, late diagnosis, underlying health conditions, or lack of access to healthcare. Overall, the death rate remained practically negligible, indicating successful management of the disease severities.
