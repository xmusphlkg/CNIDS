## Introduction

Cholera is an infectious disease caused by the Vibrio cholerae bacterium. It primarily affects the intestinal tract and is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration. Cholera transmission occurs through contaminated water or food consumption. The disease is a major health problem in many developing countries where access to clean water and sanitation facilities are limited. Quick rehydration is the core treatment strategy, supplemented by antibiotics when necessary. Effective preventive measures include improved sanitation, safe drinking water, and cholera vaccines.

## Highlights

- Cholera cases in the Chinese mainland show a clear seasonal trend peaking during the summer months especially in July and August, and then decreasing through the autumn and winter. <br/>
- The highest number of cases were reported in October 2016 with 11 cases, but overall, the disease incidence remains relatively low. <br/>
- Notably, there have been no reported deaths due to Cholera from 2014 to April 2024, suggesting effective management and treatment implementation amongst health services. <br/>
- As of April 2024, no cases have been reported for the year, possibly due to the typical lower case frequency in winter and early spring months.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Cholera in the Chinese mainland span across a decade, starting from April 2014. The data suggests that the occurrence of Cholera cases exhibits a clear seasonal pattern, with peaks during the summer months, especially in August (e.g., 12 cases in 2018 and 2023), and a scarcity of cases during the winter months. The highest number of cases ever recorded in a single month was 12 in August 2018 and August 2023. It's also notable that there are some dormancy periods with no recorded cases, such as January to April in 2020 and 2021, suggesting potential successful preventive measures.  

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the number of recorded Cholera cases, the data remarkably shows a zero-death rate throughout the observed period. This implies that the disease management methods employed in response to the Cholera cases have been effective. The data covers both high case periods and low case periods, reinforcing the success of these treatment strategies. Given the potentially fatal nature of untreated Cholera, the maintained zero-death rate over the decade is a remarkable achievement and testament to the efficacy of the Chinese mainland's healthcare system.
