## Introduction

Rabies is a fatal viral disease primarily transmitted through the bite of an infected animal, often dogs. The rabies virus invades the central nervous system, causing disease in the brain and ultimately, death. Symptoms include fever, muscle weakness, and aggression. Despite being preventable through vaccination and proactive care, rabies continues to result in tens of thousands of deaths annually, particularly in regions with limited access to healthcare. Furthermore, lack of public awareness exacerbates the problem by permitting rapid disease dissemination.

## Highlights

- Rabies cases and deaths in Chinese mainland have significantly declined from 2014 to 2024. Cases dropped from 54 (April 2014) to 9 (April 2024), and deaths from 53 to 8 in the same period. <br/> 
- Despite some seasonal peaks, the downward trend is consistent over the decade. <br/> 
- A high case fatality rate, often nearing 100%, indicates the severe nature of Rabies. <br/>
- Sporadic spikes in deaths relative to case numbers (e.g., December 2022 and January 2023) highlight the persistent risks and severity of the disease.


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
There has been a general reduction in rabies cases reported in Chinese mainland from 2014 till date. Since the peak of 105 cases in September 2014, there hasn't been a single month where case count exceeded 100. The data shows a gradual decline with occasional spikes, possibly indicating enhanced control measures. As of April 2024, count stands at 9, substantially lower than the 54 cases reported at the same time in 2014. However, the consistent presence of cases shows sustained rabies transmission.

### Deaths Analysis
Deaths due to rabies show a similar trend as observed in cases, declining gradually over these years. The highest number of deaths was reported as 97 in September 2014, with no subsequent month reaching this peak. While there are occasional increases in numbers, like 91 deaths in December 2015, the general trend significantly reduces over time. By April 2024, the death count was 8, a stark improvement from 2014's figures. Despite this reduction, continued fatalities emphasize the fatality of this zoonotic disease without prompt post-exposure prophylaxis.
