## Introduction

Hepatitis C is a viral infection that primarily affects the liver, leading to both acute and chronic illnesses. It is caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is transmitted through direct contact with infected human blood. Consequences range from a mild illness lasting only a few weeks to serious, lifelong illnesses like cirrhosis or liver cancer. Globally, an estimated 71 million individuals have chronic Hepatitis C infections. Unfortunately, a significant number of those chronically infected will develop cirrhosis or liver cancer. There is currently no vaccine for Hepatitis C.

## Highlights

1. Hepatitis C cases in the Chinese mainland declined steadily from 2014 - 2022, but rose again in 2023. <br/>
2. Death rates escalated markedly from August 2022, peaking at 393 in December 2023, signaling a serious health concern. <br/>
3. The erratic pattern of cases and deaths suggests influence by external factors such as healthcare quality or new disease strains. <br/>
4. As of April 2024, the disease situation remains alarming with 21,905 reported cases and 209 deaths, showing ongoing difficulties in outbreak management.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, Hepatitis C had a variable incidence rate in mainland China, with a notable peak in March 2023 (23,625 cases). Lower rates generally occurred in February, possibly due to seasonal factors and the Chinese New Year holiday, when people might be less inclined to seek medical care. A more marked dip was seen in February 2020 (9,068 cases), probably attributable to overwhelming focus on COVID-19. The years 2022 and 2023 showed significant increases in cases possibly indicating either wider spread of the virus or improvements in detection practices over the years.

### Deaths Analysis
Between 2014 and 2019, the mortality rate remained low, generally ranging between 4 and 14 deaths per month. However, a sharp increase in deaths was observed from August 2022 onward. The most drastic surge occurred in December 2023, accounting for 393 deaths, an approximately 30-fold increase from the highest recorded deaths in the earlier years. The high mortality rate in later years indicates a potential worsening of health navigation, accessibility of health services, and/or effectiveness of treatment or it could be linked to increased severity of incident cases.
