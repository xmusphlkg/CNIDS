## Introduction

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease prevalent in children. It's caused by the measles virus and transmitted via airborne droplets from infected individuals. Major symptoms include fever, cough, white spots inside the mouth, and a skin rash. Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, measles still causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates. Serious complications can include blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhea, and pneumonia. Ensuring high vaccination coverage is essential in the prevention and control of measles outbreaks.

## Highlights

- There is a significant decrease in measles cases in the Chinese mainland region from 2014 to 2024, indicating long-term success in controlling the disease.<br/>
- Peak measles cases used to be seen in the spring (around April), however, the intensity of the peak has lessened over the years.<br/>
- Measles-related deaths have also decreased to zero since 2016, showing improved case management and potentially higher vaccination rates.<br/>
- Despite the success, vigilance is required as the latest data in April 2024 shows a jump to 148 cases from 66 the previous month, the highest since 2016.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The given data spanning over a decade shows a dramatic decrease in the reported cases of measles in the Chinese mainland from 2014 to 2024. The highest recorded cases were in April 2014, with 11089 cases. The trend depicts a gradual decrease, with a noticeable dip in 2020 possibly reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures in reducing communicable disease incidences. In recent years, the data exhibits a stabilization trend with periodical peaks, highlighting the need for continued public health efforts to vaccinate and monitor measles.

### Deaths Analysis
The death rate associated with measles in the Chinese mainland is significantly low, despite the number of cases. A peak of 7 deaths was reported in April 2015. Interestingly, from August 2017 to currently, there have been no recorded deaths from measles, suggesting effective management of cases, possibly due to improved healthcare access and treatment modalities. However, the presence of any death underscores the significant burden of measles in the population and the importance of robust immunization programs for eradication.
