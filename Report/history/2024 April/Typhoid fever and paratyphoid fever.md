## Introduction

Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are infectious diseases caused by the bacteria Salmonella typhi and Salmonella paratyphi, respectively. Both illnesses are characterized by high fevers, abdominal pain, and other severe symptoms, transmitted through contaminated food, water, or close contact. They remain major health concerns worldwide, particularly in developing regions with poor sanitation. While antibiotics are effective treatment options, vaccination provides the best preventive measure. Increasing antimicrobial resistance, however, complicates treatment efforts for these diseases.

## Highlights

- There's a clear seasonal pattern for Typhoid and Paratyphoid fever in mainland China, with a peak in warmer months (April-September).<br/>
- Over the decade, cases have generally decreased, from a high of 1787 in September 2014 to 354 in April 2024.<br/>
- Deaths are consistently low and do not correlate with case numbers, suggesting effective treatment approaches.<br/>
- As of April 2024, the disease situation is manageable, with 354 cases and no reported deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Throughout 2014 to 2024, the reported cases of Typhoid and Paratyphoid fever in mainland China have displayed a recurrent seasonal pattern, often peaking in summer months (June - August), which coincides with the warmer climates conducive for bacterial growth. It's noticeable that the number of cases has generally declined over the years, from the highest in June 2014 with 1498 cases to lowest in February 2024 with only 190 cases. This decline might be attributed to improved sanitation, drinking water quality, and increased awareness about hygiene practices among the populace.

### Deaths Analysis
In the same period, deaths due to these fevers have been relatively scarce despite the fluctuating number of cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of modern therapeutic interventions and the healthcare system's capacity to manage these infections. Notably, the deaths seem randomly distributed rather than correlating with the peak case periods. While the reasons for this distribution pattern aren't immediately clear from the data, it may be connected with factors such as individual health conditions, timely access to healthcare, or effectiveness of treatment received.
