## Introduction

Poliomyelitis, commonly known as polio, is a highly infectious viral disease predominantly affecting children under 5. The virus is transmitted person-to-person, usually through contaminated water or food. It invades the nervous system, potentially causing total paralysis in hours. Tragically, 5 to 10% of those experiencing paralysis die when their breathing muscles become immobilized. Despite there being no cure, polio is preventable with multiple doses of the polio vaccine, which has reduced worldwide cases by over 99% since 1988.

## Highlights

- There have been no reported cases of Poliomyelitis in mainland China from April 2014 to April 2024. <br/>
- Similarly, there have been no reported deaths due to Poliomyelitis in mainland China for the same observation period. <br/>
- These trends suggest a successful elimination of the Poliomyelitis in mainland China over the decade in review.<br/>
- As of April 2024, the disease situation for Poliomyelitis in mainland China seems controlled with zero new cases and deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data provided summarizes Poliomyelitis cases reported in Chinese mainland between April 2014 and April 2024. This ten-year span portrays an attestation of zero Polio cases throughout the entire period. This significant achievement suggests successful prevention and control strategies, including exhaustive vaccination and surveillance programs. The sustained zero-case scenario reflects a possible Polio-free status, aligning with global efforts towards Polio eradication. Continual surveillance remains vital to early detect and respond to any potential importation or resurgence.

### Deaths Analysis
Simultaneously, the data reports no deaths associated with Poliomyelitis during this ten-year period. The absence of Polio-related mortality is a noteworthy indicator of the effective healthcare measures in place. It points to not only the efficiency of the preventive strategies, such as vaccination campaigns, but also the diagnostic and treatment protocols applied in case of illness onset. The consistent zero mortality rate reaffirms China's progress in maintaining its Polio eradication status. Vigilance should be maintained to preserve this achievement.
