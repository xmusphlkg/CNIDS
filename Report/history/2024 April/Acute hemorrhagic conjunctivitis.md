## Introduction

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) is a highly infectious, rapidly spreading ocular disease manifested by the reddening and swelling of the conjunctiva - the clear, thin tissue covering the white of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids. Symptoms include eye pain, light sensitivity, and blurred vision. It's primarily caused by the enterovirus (EV70) and coxsackievirus A24 variant. Despite its alarming appearance, the condition is generally self-limiting, typically resolving without treatment within 7 to 14 days.


## Highlights

1. Case numbers of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in Chinese mainland have fluctuated month to month but demonstrate a clear annual peak in August or September. <br/>
2. Despite these fluctuations, there are only three recorded deaths linked to the disease between 2014 and April 2024, indicating low fatality. <br/>
3. A major outbreak occurred in September 2023 with 125,264 cases, far exceeding the usual peak. Post-outbreak, the monthly cases returned to their usual range. <br/>
4. As of April 2024, the situation appears to be stable with 2803 cases, indicating no significant continuities from the 2023 outbreak.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data shows that the number of Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis cases in Chinese mainland experienced usual cyclical fluctuations over the years from 2014 to 2023, peaking around mid-year (June-July), then decreasing towards the end of each year. However, each year saw a gradual increase in the number of cases. Notably, there was a significant spike in cases in 2023 with the highest number of cases reported in September at 125,264. This indicates a severe and uncommon outbreak, necessitating focused investigation and public health action to control the spread. The data from 2024 starts similar to previous years, suggesting a potential return to normal incidence rates.

### Deaths Analysis
According to the data, Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis in Chinese mainland had a low fatality rate, with only three reported deaths occurring across the 12 years span. Two deaths were reported in February 2020 and one in August 2019. Despite the significant outbreak in 2023, no deaths were reported, indicating improved case management or milder disease manifestations. However, it's important to conduct more rigorous epidemiological investigations to find any unreported or misclassified deaths related to this disease to provide a more accurate picture of the disease's fatality rate.
