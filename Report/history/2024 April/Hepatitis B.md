## Introduction

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver, causing acute or chronic disease. The virus is transmitted through exposure to blood, semen, or other body fluids of an infected person. High-risk groups include those who have unprotected sexual contact, share needles, or are exposed to it at birth. Symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and liver damage. Since the late 1980s, a vaccine has been available to prevent the spread of the disease. Despite these preventive measures, Hepatitis B remains a global health problem, particularly in parts of Asia and Africa.

## Highlights

1. There is a noticeable increase in reported Hepatitis B cases from 2014 to 2024. <br/>
2. The disease incidence peaks in some months indicating seasonal trends; for example, there is a relatively high number of cases in the month of March in different years. <br/>
3. Mortality rates, in contrast, do not show a clear increase over time and relatively remain steady suggesting improvements in disease management. <br/>
4. There was a sharp drop in reported cases in February 2020 which could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic which may have affected healthcare-seeking behaviors and reporting.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From 2014 to 2024, Hepatitis B cases in mainland China displayed a general uptrend, notwithstanding periodic fluctuations. While monthly case numbers dipped below 70,000 in 2020 likely due to factors related to the COVID-19 epidemic, they recovered in subsequent years reaching a high above 150,000 in 2024. Notably, there were consistent peaks observed around March each year, indicating a seasonal tendency for the disease. However, since Hepatitis B can be prevented through vaccination, the increasing trend might suggest lagging vaccination coverage, population growth, or improved case reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths linked to Hepatitis B infection in the same period remained relatively consistent from 20 to 55 per month, not directly correlating with the rise in case numbers. This may be attributed to more effective treatments and health interventions, thus reducing fatality rates. Fluctuations in monthly deaths did not display a clear seasonal pattern. An exception was a notable peak of 80 deaths in January 2020. This divergence of trend between case records and deaths signals the importance of investigating case severity and healthcare response over time.
