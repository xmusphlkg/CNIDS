## Introduction

Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the Hepatitis E Virus (HEV). It's typically transmitted through contaminated water or food, particularly undercooked pork or deer meat. Symptoms include jaundice, fatigue, and nausea, sometimes leading to severe complications like liver failure. Although there are four genotypes affecting humans, the disease is most prevalent in East and South Asia. Currently, there's no specific treatment available; instead, supportive care is provided to manage symptoms. Since 2011, a vaccine has been available in China but remains unlicensed elsewhere.


## Highlights

1. Hepatitis E cases in Chinese mainland have steadily decreased from 2014-2020, from around 2150 monthly cases to an average of 1675 monthly cases in 2020.<br/>
2. Cases drop below 2000 per month in 2020 possibly due to effective interventions or diminished reporting.<br/>
3. Since 2021, a resurgence is observed, escalating to 3593 cases by April 2024.<br/>
4. Despite significant morbidity, the lethal nature of Hepatitis E remains consistently low, typically averaging 1-2 monthly deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Hepatitis E cases fluctuated in Chinese mainland from April 2014 to April 2024. A general pattern showed high case numbers in the months of March, January, and December each year, suggesting a possible seasonality to the virus or a correlation with the Chinese New Year where mass migration and dense gathering are common, possibly contributing to a higher spread. Although there were sporadic drops and surges, there was an overall gradual increase in case numbers over the 10-year period, with cases significantly rising from an average of about 2000 cases per month in 2014 to almost 3000 per month in 2024.

### Deaths Analysis
The death count from Hepatitis E is relatively low compared to the number of reported cases. Over the 10-year period, the highest number of related deaths reported in a month was only 6, occurring in December 2017. More frequently, monthly deaths often ranged between 0-3, indicating a relatively low fatality rate for the infection. The deaths did not show any clear seasonal pattern, suggesting other factors may be influential, such as underlying health conditions of the infected individuals. It's also worth noting a consistent low mortality rate despite the increase in cases, possibly pointing to improved medical interventions or reporting accuracies.
