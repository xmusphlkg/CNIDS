## Introduction

Neonatal tetanus is a life-threatening bacterial infection affecting new-born infants, generally caused by unhygienic delivery and cord-care practices. The bacterium, Clostridium tetani, enters the body through a fresh wound, often the umbilical stump, and releases a toxin leading to severe muscle stiffness and spasms. Despite being preventable through immunization and clean birthing practices, the disease is prevalent in under-resourced regions where such amenities are not widely available and contributes significantly to neonatal mortality.

## Highlights

- Over the decade from 2014 to 2024, there has been a significant downward trend in the number of Neonatal tetanus cases and associated fatalities in mainland China. <br/>
- An initial surge in cases seen in 2014 with a peak of 58 cases in September, gradually declined to single-digit cases per month from 2017 onward.<br/>
- The number of fatal cases also fell, with regular monthly deaths only until 2017, after which they sporadically occurred. <br/>
- As of April 2024, there have been no recent cases or deaths reported, signifying an effective disease control and prevention strategy in place.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The dataset illustrates a decreasing trend of Neonatal tetanus cases from the years 2014 to 2024. The highest number of cases was in September 2014, with 58 confirmed instances, while the lowest was in March and June of 2021 and  March and May of 2024 with no cases. There is a substantial reduction of cases which can be attributed to improved immunization and antenatal care coverage, health education promoting clean delivery, and hygienic cord care practices. However, vigilance is required to maintain the decreasing trend, given the cyclic nature of communicable diseases. (Word Count: 89)

### Deaths Analysis
Interestingly, despite the substantial reduction in Neonatal tetanus cases, the death counts' downtrend seems less rapid. The highest number of deaths, three, was reported in October 2015. However, even as the number of cases significantly decreases, notably to zero in 2021 and 2024, there are still recorded death cases in March 2021 and August 2022. This pattern underscores the vital importance of timely and appropriate case management to prevent fatalities in the event of infection. Public health efforts should, therefore, focus on not only prevention but also treatment efficiency.  (Word Count: 99)
