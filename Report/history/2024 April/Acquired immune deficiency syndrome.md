## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, life-threatening condition caused by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It degrades the immune system, preventing the body's ability to combat other viruses, infections, and diseases. The virus is transmitted through direct contact with certain bodily fluids of a person who has HIV. Symptoms differ in different stages, from flu-like problems in early stages to severe illnesses in advanced stages. There's currently no cure for HIV/AIDS, but medications can dramatically slow disease progression.

## Highlights

- An upward trend in Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases was noted from 3369 in April 2014 to 5357 in April 2024, marking a significant increase over a decade.<br/>
- Monthly deaths also saw significant growth, rising from 883 in April 2014 to 1718 in April 2024.<br/>
- Fluctuations are present but the overall pattern shows an increased prevalence and lethality of AIDS in mainland China.<br/>
- December 2018 and December 2021 recorded the highest cases (7897) and deaths (2486) respectively.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The data on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) cases in mainland China from April 2014 to April 2024 demonstrates an overall fluctuating trend with periods of significant increases and slight decreases. It indicates a cyclical nature, with a surge in cases often seen at regular intervals, particularly towards the end and beginning of each year. The highest reported cases occurred in December 2021 with 7490 cases. Though there are variations, a general increase in the number of reported cases over the years is notable, reflecting the persistent prevalence and spread of the disease in the region.

### Deaths Analysis
In analyzing the death data due to AIDS over the same ten-year period, a rising trend is observed, showing increased fatalities over time. A pattern of peaks and troughs is seen throughout the data, with the highest number of deaths occurring in December 2021 with 2486 deaths. However, the overall trend shows that the number of deaths tends to increase around the end of the year and begin to decrease during the start of the next year. This pattern indicates a continuous public health challenge posed by AIDS in mainland China, necessitating urgent preventive measures and effective management strategies.
