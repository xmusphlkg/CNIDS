## Introduction

Infectious diarrhea, caused by viruses, bacteria, or parasites, is a common condition that results in frequent, loose, or watery stools. It primarily spreads through contaminated food, water, or person-to-person contact, often resulting in outbreaks in communities. Symptoms typically include abdominal cramps, fever, and nausea. Although it's usually self-limiting, it can cause serious complications like dehydration, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Prevention includes maintaining good hygiene practices and ensuring food and water safety.


## Highlights

- Infectious diarrhea cases peak during the summer months (June, July, August), decreasing in cooler months like December, February.<br/>
- From 2014 to 2024, despite fluctuations, cases generally increased suggesting endemic trends with occasional surges.<br/>
- The consistently low fatality rate highlights effective treatment and recovery for most cases.<br/>
- The significant rise in cases from February to April 2024 underlines the need for continuous surveillance and disease control efforts.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The total number of infectious diarrhea cases in Chinese mainland typically demonstrated an annual cyclic trend, with more cases diagnosed in warmer months (May to September) and declining in colder months (November to March). The highest peak was observed in December 2017, with 174,969 cases. In recent years, there has been a persistent rise in cases, but the overall upward trend doesn't seem consistent, as notable decreases also sporadically occur. Early data from 2024 suggests a record number of cases, with 196,347 reported in March, the highest monthly count so far.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the relatively high number of cases, deaths due to infectious diarrhea have remained considerably low throughout the years, often totaling fewer than five deaths per month irrespective of the prevalence of cases. July 2014 recorded the highest monthly death toll of seven. Interestingly, there is no established correlation between the number of cases and deaths, suggesting an effective healthcare response in managing the disease. From 2020, the death rate fell even further, with several months reporting zero fatalities, an exemplary feat considering the high number of reported cases.
