## Introduction

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma species of flatworms. It is primarily transmitted through contact with contaminated water, where parasite larvae penetrate human skin. Though acute infections can be asymptomatic, chronic disease can cause damaging immune reactions, typically affecting the bladder, kidneys, liver, or intestines. It is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in poor communities without access to clean water and sanitation. Schistosomiasis is considered a neglected tropical disease, with an estimated 240 million people infected worldwide.

## Highlights

- A decline in Schistosomiasis cases across the Chinese mainland has been evidenced within the last decade, from 11,481 cases (2015, November) to only 2 (2024, April), indicating effective disease control measures. <br/>
- Despite the case reductions, the re-emerging peaks in cases (such as in 2017 & 2022) emphasize the importance of maintaining control efforts. <br/>
- The only recorded death occurred in February 2020. This isolated incident implies both a significant improvement in treatment strategies and changes in disease severity. <br/>
- The consistently low cases in recent years underscore the importance of persistent surveillance for the early detection and control of potential outbreaks.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Schistosomiasis cases in the Chinese mainland display a downward trend from 2014 through 2024. The year 2015 reported the highest number of cases, with a peak of 10,481 instances in November. In the following years, though, a significant decrease is observed, and from 2017 onwards, the disease seems to remain at low levels with monthly cases rarely exceeding 100. The recurring increase in cases around October, particularly noticeable in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2016, suggests possible seasonal influences on the disease's proliferation.

### Deaths Analysis
Despite the considerable number of Schistosomiasis cases in the Chinese mainland from 2014 through 2024, the disease generally exhibits a zero mortality rate, indicating effective treatments or mild disease presentations. A solitary death reported in February 2020 disrupts this trend yet doesn't appear indicative of increasing disease severity over time. The recorded data, therefore, suggests good disease management and effective medical intervention against Schistosomiasis in mainland China.
