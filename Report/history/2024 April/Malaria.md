## Introduction

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Five parasite species cause malaria in humans, with Plasmodium falciparum being the most deadly. The disease is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. Symptoms, including fever, headache, and chills, appear 10-15 days post-infection. Without prompt and effective treatment, malaria can lead to severe illness and death. Despite significant progress, there were 409,000 malaria-related deaths in 2019, according to the World Health Organization. Prevention strategies include mosquito control and antimalarial drugs.

## Highlights

1. Significant reduction in Malaria cases and deaths in mainland China observed from April 2014 (243 cases) to April 2024 (190 cases), indicating effective disease control.<br/>
2. Sharp decrease in cases in early 2020 possibly due to COVID-19 control measures.<br/>
3. Despite fluctuations, an increase in cases from 2022 noticed, suggesting continued risk of transmission.<br/>
4. Unforeseen rise in cases in August 2022 (217) underscores Malaria's unpredictability and the need for ongoing surveillance and control strategies.<br/>


## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported Malaria cases in the Chinese mainland display a gradual decline from 2014 to 2021, followed by a moderate resurgence in 2022 onwards. There appears to be recurring seasonal variation, with peak incidences often noted during the summer months of June and July. Despite the overall reduction, there is an unexpected surge of 217 reported cases in August 2022. As of April 2024, cases remain less frequent than the pre-2020 period, suggesting ongoing but partial success in containing the disease spread.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of recorded Malaria-related fatalities in the Chinese mainland throughout this period remained low, never exceeding five in a single month. Deaths are randomly distributed, not showing any clear seasonal pattern or correlation with case numbers. The fewest fatalities were recorded in 2020, coinciding with the most significant drop in the number of recorded cases. In recent years (2022-2024), deaths have remained low even with a slight increase in case numbers, suggesting an improved management or lower virulence of the disease.
