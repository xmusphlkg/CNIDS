## Introduction

Plague is a serious, potentially lethal infectious disease caused by the Yersinia pestis bacteria. It primarily affects rodents like rats and spreads to humans through infected fleas' bites. The disease manifests in three forms: Bubonic, characterized by swollen lymph nodes; Septicemic, affecting the blood; and Pneumonic, targeting the lungs. The plague has historically caused widespread pandemics, most notably the Black Death in the 14th century. Today, it can be treated effectively with antibiotics if detected early.

## Highlights

- The Plague shows a sporadic pattern in Chinese Mainland with very few Cases occurring over the past decade (2014-2024).<br/>
- The notable peak in Cases was in November 2019 with 4 reported Cases but an absence of fatalities.<br/>
- A concerning factor is the existence of deaths, which indicates the disease's possible presence in the background population with sporadic case identification.<br/>
- Currently, by April 2024, no new cases or deaths have been reported indicating an inactive phase of the disease.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data from 2014 to 2024 reveals sporadic cases of Plague in mainland China. Over a total of 10 years, scattered cases appear with little clustering or pattern, with an irregular rhythm and a tendency towards 0-2 cases per occurrence. A notable surge appears in November 2019 with 4 cases. From 2014 through 2018, the frequency of cases is lower than in the years following 2019. In time, fluctuations in the frequency of documented instances suggest an ongoing surveillance of the situation rather than an established control over plague occurrences.

### Deaths Analysis
Death records coincide directly with reported cases for most of the time, implying that victims often succumb to the disease. Part probable explanation could be late diagnosis, which is not unusual for Plague due to its rarity. A relatively high mortality rate is visualized in periods like 2014 and 2016-2017 where each reported case results in death. A shift is noticed after 2018 with some survival cases registered, hinting at possible improvements in timely diagnosis and treatment. However, the latest data up to 2024 shows that mortality associated with Plague in China still persists.
