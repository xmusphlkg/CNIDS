## Introduction

Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough, is a highly contagious bacterial infection caused by Bordetella pertussis. It notably affects the respiratory tract and is characterized by severe coughing fits that often end in a "whooping" sound during the intake of breath. It primarily spreads through droplets from coughing or sneezing. Although vaccines have significantly reduced its prevalence, pertussis remains a public health concern in many parts of the world. High risk groups include unvaccinated infants and people with compromised immune systems. Effective treatment generally involves antibiotics.

## Highlights

- There's a significant upward trend in Pertussis cases in the Chinese mainland, climaxing at 91,272 cases in April 2024.<br/>
- Spikes in cases often occur in the second half of years, indicating possible seasonal influences.<br/>
- Despite rising case numbers, Pertussis-related deaths remain relatively low, with a peak of 8 in February 2024.<br/>
- The fluctuating nature suggests potential reporting biases or varying seasonal transmission factors.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported data of Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, cases in mainland China, shows a significant increase over the ten years spanning from 2014 to 2024. Starting from only 156 cases in April 2014, by April of 2024, the number had escalated to an alarming 91,272 cases. Notably, there was a sharp rise of cases starting from 2017, with steeper increases noted each consecutive summer and fall period. This could be attributed to seasonal changes affecting disease prevalence or reporting rates. The sudden exponential increase in cases in the year 2024 points towards a severe outbreak or significant changes in case detection and reporting.

### Deaths Analysis
In contrast to the escalating trend of cases, the number of deaths remained relatively low over the ten-year period. While there are fluctuations, the total number of reported deaths each year has only occasionally reached above 1. The highest death count is seen in February 2024 with 8 deaths. Generally, a high number of cases with a low death rate may be indicative of a well-managed healthcare system responding to the outbreaks. Despite the increasing disease incidence and potential burden on the healthcare system, the controlled number of fatalities reflects the effectiveness of treatment protocols and public health measures.
