## Introduction

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic and potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The virus damages the immune system, hindering the body's ability to fight infections and diseases. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection, characterized by the development of certain cancers, infections, or other severe clinical manifestations. It was first recognized in the early 1980s and has since become a global pandemic. Treatment involves antiretroviral therapy (ART) which, while not a cure, can significantly prolong and improve the lives of those living with HIV.

## Highlights

- A steady increase in the number of both Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases and deaths has been witnessed from 2010 to 2023 in mainland China. <br/>
- There is a persistent upward trend observed even in the year 2023, indicating a growing health concern. <br/>
- Particularly, the death rate due to AIDS has seen a significant surge in early 2023. <br/>
- Despite considerable advances in global medical services, the situation remains challenging and demands persistent efforts towards control and prevention of AIDS.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in mainland China present significant month-to-month flactuations, with observable increasing trends over the long term. The numbers start from approximately 1,663 in January 2010, followed by a rise and fall pattern across subsequent years peaking at about 7,897 in December 2018. Following this peak, the cases have generally declined, although with an upswing centered in the latter half of subsequent years. Based on the presented data, it appears that the burden of AIDS in mainland China is still considerable and remains an issue of major concern.

### Deaths Analysis
The data on reported AIDS-related deaths exhibits an upward trend across the same period, despite variations between individual months. In the early part of the period under consideration (January 2010), deaths were around 301 per month, but these rose to about 2,486 per month by December 2021, marking a considerable increase. However, it is noteworthy that within the same period, monthly deaths had already approached this figure in late 2018. The variations in AIDS-related deaths are indicative of the evolving nature of the epidemic, warranting ongoing surveillance and adaptive strategies to mitigate its impact.
