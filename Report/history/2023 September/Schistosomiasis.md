## Introduction

Schistosomiasis, also known as bilharzia, is a parasitic disease caused by trematode worms of the genus Schistosoma. Transmitted through exposure to freshwater contaminated by the worms' larvae, it primarily affects the urinary tract or intestines. People become infected when larval forms of the parasite, released by freshwater snails, penetrate the skin during contact with infested water. Chronic infection can lead to liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. Schistosomiasis is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions, with significant health impacts in some of the world's poorest communities.

## Highlights

1. There has been a drastic decrease in the number of Schistosomiasis cases in mainland China from 2010 through 2023, indicating successful control measures.<br/>
2. Significant peaks were observed in 2015 with a high of 10481 cases in November but then followed a sharp decline, probably due to large-scale interventions.<br/>
3. Fatalities have remained extremely low, suggesting effective clinical management of detected cases.<br/>
4. As of September 2023, the Schistosomiasis situation in China appears to be well under control, with a month average of under 10 cases and no reported deaths.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
From the provided dataset, we can deduce that schistosomiasis cases in mainland China fluctuate with high and low extremes. From 2010, there has been a steady rise in reported cases per month, peaking dramatically in 2015 with a high of 10481 cases in November. This surge was followed by a considerable decrease. By 2017, the numbers had drastically dropped to hundreds and tens, with a notable spike in October (3144 cases). However, since then, there has been an ongoing downward trend, with recent years, such as 2023, reporting single-digit cases.

### Deaths Analysis
The death toll due to Schistosomiasis in mainland China is relatively low respective to the number of reported cases. Out of the total reported cases from 2010 - 2023, deaths occurred in just 7 months. The highest number of deaths was reported in June 2012 with 3 fatalities. It can be concluded that a robust healthcare system and early diagnosis probably contributed to a low mortality rate, despite the significant number of infections in some years.
