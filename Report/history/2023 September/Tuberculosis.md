## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infection primarily affecting the lungs, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It can also impact other parts of the body, including the kidneys, spine, and brain. TB is typically spread through the air when a person with active respiratory disease coughs or sneezes. Many people can harbor the bacteria without symptoms, a condition known as latent TB. When the immune system weakens, latent TB can progress to active TB, which can be fatal if left untreated. Treatment involves a long-term regimen of antibiotics to fully eradicate the infection.

## Highlights

- The data shows a general decrease in both TB cases and deaths in Chinese mainland from 2010 to 2023.<br/>
- Despite the overall decline, there are noticeable seasonal spikes, particularly in the spring (March to May). It's possible that these increases could be linked to varying environmental factors or healthcare system variables.<br/>
- Starting from 2022, while the number of TB cases continues to decline, death count starts to rise significantly, indicating an increased mortality rate. This needs further investigation for potential causes.<br/>
- As of September 2023, the number of TB cases stands at 61,859 with 324 deaths reported, reflecting the continued trend of decreasing cases but an elevated death rate compared to earlier years.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

Based on the provided data, tuberculosis cases in Chinese mainland have shown a general decreasing trend over the observed period from January 2010 to September 2023. Peaks are regularly seen in March each year, suggesting seasonal variations. Nonetheless, the total cases reported from year to year have been steadily decreasing, possibly due to improvements in detection and treatment methods. In particular, a significant drop was observed in 2020, likely due to strict lockdown measures applied to control the COVID-19 pandemic which may have hindered tuberculosis transmission.

### Deaths Analysis

The numbers of deaths due to tuberculosis have remained relatively stable from 2010 to around 2019, despite the decreasing trend of total reported cases. This constancy could imply enduring problems in late diagnosis or treatment effectiveness. However, an unusual increase was observed starting from 2022, which may suggest possible issues within the healthcare system or a change in disease virulence. Further investigation is required to confirm and address these potential problems.
