## Introduction

Monkeypox is a zoonotic viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus, which is part of the same family of viruses as variola virus, the agent responsible for smallpox. It was first identified in 1958 in monkeys kept for research, with the first human case recorded in 1970. Monkeypox occurs primarily in central and western African countries, with occasional outbreaks elsewhere due mainly to international travel or animal imports. Transmission can occur through contact with infected animals, humans, or contaminated materials, with symptoms resembling smallpox, although generally less severe. Vaccination against smallpox has been shown to be protective against monkeypox.

## Highlights

- As of September 2023, Chinese mainland has reported 80 confirmed cases of Monkeypox with no associated fatalities. <br/>
- This data indicates that while the virus is present and leading to infections, the current outbreak appears to be contained without mortality, suggesting effective management of severe cases. <br/>
- The health authorities may have implemented efficient diagnostic, isolation, and care procedures to mitigate the spread and impact of the disease, given the low case number and absence of deaths. <br/>
- Ongoing surveillance, public health measures, and possible vaccination campaigns should be observed for insights into China's strategies to maintain control over Monkeypox outbreaks. <br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

In September 2023, Chinese mainland reported a total of 80 cases of Monkeypox. Such figures represent real-time tracking of disease prevalence, albeit without historical data, it's difficult to contextualize the trend. The number could indicate either a contained outbreak, a rise, or a decline in cases. Given that Monkeypox is generally a self-limiting disease with symptoms lasting 2-4 weeks, the current caseload should precipitate targeted containment strategies, monitoring of contacts, and perhaps vaccination of high-risk individuals, if available and deemed necessary.

### Deaths Analysis

The reported data for September 2023 shows zero deaths from Monkeypox in Chinese mainland, suggesting either a non-lethal strain of the virus or an effective healthcare response. The fatality rate of Monkeypox varies by strain, with the Congo Basin clade having a higher lethality compared to the West African clade. The absence of fatalities might also imply timely diagnostics, adequate medical care, and possible access to antivirals that are being used in other regions. This would likely contribute to a positive prognosis for those infected. Nonetheless, ongoing surveillance is essential to manage the disease effectively.
