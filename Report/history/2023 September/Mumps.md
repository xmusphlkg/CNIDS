## Introduction

Mumps is a highly contagious viral disease caused by the mumps virus, a member of the paramyxovirus family. It's primarily characterized by the painful swelling of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, located near the ears, which can result in a distinctive "chipmunk cheek" appearance. Other symptoms may include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. Mumps is typically transmitted through respiratory secretions or saliva. Since the introduction of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, occurrences have dramatically decreased, though outbreaks still happen, particularly in areas with low vaccination coverage.

### Deaths Analysis

Mumps-related deaths in Chinese mainland are extremely low relative to the number of reported cases. Between 2010 and 2023, there were a total of only 14 recorded deaths attributable to mumps. The highest number of deaths in a single month (4) was reported in January 2020. Unlike case numbers, there does not appear to be a pronounced seasonal pattern for deaths. It's crucial to remember though, while deaths from mumps are rare, complications can occur, leading to severe health issues.
