## Introduction

Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF), also known as viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF), encompasses a group of illnesses caused by four distinct families of viruses: Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae. These diseases are characterized by fever and bleeding disorders, and can progress to high fever, shock, and multi-organ failure in severe cases. Transmission to humans occurs via contact with infected animal hosts or in some cases, through mosquito or tick bites. Examples of VHFs include Ebola, Dengue, and Lassa fever. These conditions pose significant public health challenges due to their potential for outbreaks and high fatality rates.

## Highlights

- A consistent trend in the data shows a significant increase in Epidemic hemorrhagic fever cases and deaths during winter, specifically in the months of November and December. <br/>
- Over the span of 2010 to 2023, there is a gradual decrease in overall reported cases and fatalities each year which signals a positive trend towards epidemic control. <br/>
- The highest recorded number of cases and deaths occurred in November 2012 with 3000 reported cases and 25 fatalities.<br/>
- As of September 2023, cases have substantially reduced with only 198 reported and a single fatality, suggesting effective control and preventive measures in place.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis

The reported data shows that cases of Epidemic hemorrhagic fever in Chinese mainland appear to follow a recurring annual trend, with the highest numbers occurring towards the end of the year—particularly in October through December, and the lowest in the start of the year—mainly from January to April. Cases generally rise from around 300-400 in the first part of the year to their high point in thousands by November or December. A spike can be observed in September 2012 with cases reaching 3000. The highest and lowest case count was observed in November 2012 and September 2023 respectively.

### Deaths Analysis

The death toll due to Epidemic hemorrhagic fever in Chinese mainland, although quite stable, tends to follow a somewhat similar trend as the case counts. Fatalities are typically lower at the start of the year with 0-2 deaths, gradually increasing throughout, and reaching a peak towards November or December. Notably, a significant surge of 150 fatalities was observed in September 2012. The deaths noticeably remain below 35 per month, showing a generally lower mortality rate corresponding to the case counts.
