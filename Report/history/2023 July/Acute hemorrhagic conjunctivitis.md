Seasonal Patterns:
An analysis of the data reveals a distinct seasonal pattern for cases of Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis (AHC) in Chinese mainland. The number of cases demonstrates a peak during the summer months, specifically in June, July, and August. Subsequently, there is a gradual decrease towards the end of the year. Notably, there is a marked increase in cases beginning in April and May, reaching its zenith during the summer months, and then declining once again towards year-end.

Peak and Trough Periods:
The peak period for incidences of AHC in Chinese mainland occurs during the summer months, particularly in June and July, with the highest number of cases reported during this time. Conversely, the trough period can be observed during the winter months, with a lower number of cases reported in November, December, January, and February.

Overall Trends:
Upon examining the overall trends, it is evident that the number of AHC cases increased from 2010 to 2015, peaking in 2015. However, subsequent to 2015, the number of cases stabilized and fluctuated to some extent, while remaining relatively high compared to previous years. No significant increasing or decreasing trend has been observed from 2015 onwards.

Discussion:
The seasonal patterns of AHC in Chinese mainland consistently demonstrate an increase in cases during the summer months, specifically in June and July, which serve as the peak months. This could be attributed to various factors, including augmented outdoor activities, higher temperatures, and increased humidity levels, all of which are conducive to the transmission and spread of the disease. In order to prevent and control the spread of AHC during peak periods, it is imperative for public health officials to be cognizant of this seasonal trend and implement necessary measures. Additionally, the continual presence and impact of AHC in Chinese mainland, as indicated by the relatively high case numbers observed beyond 2015, underscores the requirement for ongoing surveillance and control efforts to alleviate the burden of this disease.
