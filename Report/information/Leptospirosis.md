Leptospirosis, caused by the spirochete bacterium Leptospira, is a zoonotic infectious disease that is widespread worldwide. It affects both humans and animals and is typically transmitted through direct or indirect contact with the urine or tissues of infected animals. Leptospirosis is considered an emerging and neglected disease due to its increasing incidence and potential for severe outcomes.

Historical Context and Discovery:

Leptospirosis was first described in the late 1800s during an outbreak among flooded workers in Germany. The Dutch physician Adolf Weil discovered the etiological agent, Leptospira, in 1886. Subsequently, numerous outbreaks and epidemics have been reported globally, including in Japan, the United States, and various countries in Europe.

Global Prevalence:

Leptospirosis has a global distribution but is more prevalent in regions with warm and humid climates, such as tropical and subtropical areas. It affects both developed and developing countries, with prevalence varying significantly between regions. It is estimated that there are over a million cases of severe leptospirosis worldwide each year, with mortality rates ranging from 5% to 20%.

Transmission Routes:

Leptospira bacteria are shed through the urine of infected animals, primarily rodents, dogs, cattle, pigs, and wild animals. Humans become infected through direct contact with the urine or tissues of infected animals, or indirectly through contact with contaminated soil, water, or food. Transmission can occur through mucous membranes, broken skin, or inhalation of aerosols containing Leptospira.

Affected Populations:

Leptospirosis affects a wide range of populations, including farmers, sewage workers, veterinarians, abattoir workers, and military personnel. People engaged in recreational activities such as swimming or camping in bodies of water, as well as those living in urban slums and poverty-stricken areas, are also at risk. Respiratory transmission has been observed in certain occupational settings, such as rice farming and mining.

Key Statistics:

According to the World Health Organization, Leptospirosis is responsible for an estimated 1.03 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost annually. Additionally, it causes approximately 60,000 deaths worldwide each year. The disease is more common in males than females, and most cases occur in people between the ages of 5-19 and 20-49.

Risk Factors:

Several risk factors contribute to the transmission of Leptospirosis. These include exposure to contaminated water or soil through activities such as swimming, wading, or working in flooded areas; contact with animal urine or tissues during occupational or recreational activities; living in crowded and unsanitary conditions; and inadequate personal protective measures, such as wearing appropriate protective clothing and promptly cleaning infected wounds.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:

The prevalence of Leptospirosis varies across regions due to environmental, socioeconomic, and climatic factors. In tropical regions such as Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and South America, leptospirosis is endemic, with periodic outbreaks during rainy seasons or after natural disasters. In developed countries, it is more common in rural and agricultural areas where there is occupational exposure to infected animals.

Certain populations, such as indigenous communities and urban slum dwellers, are at a higher risk due to inadequate access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare facilities. Travelers to endemic regions are also at risk, particularly if engaged in outdoor activities that involve exposure to contaminated environments.

In conclusion, Leptospirosis is a globally distributed zoonotic disease with varying prevalence rates and affected demographics. Direct or indirect exposure to contaminated animal urine or tissues, as well as engagement in occupational or recreational activities involving contact with infected animals or contaminated environments, and poor sanitation, are significant risk factors for transmission. Understanding the epidemiology of Leptospirosis is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies and improving public health outcomes.
## Introduction

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by the Leptospira bacteria, typically spread to humans through the urine of infected animals. Common carriers include rodents, cattle, pigs, and dogs, although a wide range of animals can carry the disease. It's most common in tropical climates but can occur anywhere. Humans often contract Leptospirosis through contact with contaminated water, soil, or food. Symptoms include fever, headache, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, and jaundice. Severe cases can lead to kidney damage, liver failure, or meningitis. Treatment typically involves antibiotics.

## Highlights

1. There is a clear seasonality, with cases increasing significantly from June to October each year (peak leptospirosis transmission period).<br/>
2. The number of cases for September 2023 (71 cases) is higher compared to the previous year (43 cases).<br/>
3. Deaths fluctuate and are not increasing over the years. September 2023 reported no deaths, indicating improved mortality management.<br/>
4. Despite some year to year fluctuations, there's an overall decreasing trend in cases since 2010 which suggests improved prevention, or intervention measures.<br/>

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
Within the given period (2010-2023), Leptospirosis cases in mainland China show cyclic annual fluctuation with spikes in cases typically observed from August to October. This aligns with post-monsoon periods where conditions favor Leptospirosis transmission. Cases are generally lowest during the colder months (December - February). A noticeable dip in cases was seen in 2020, possibly due to COVID-19 restrictions reducing human exposure to Leptospirosis. 

### Deaths Analysis
Reported deaths from Leptospirosis are relatively low compared to cases, indicating a decent survival rate. Like cases, reported deaths also exhibit a seasonal pattern, peaking mostly in late summer and early fall (August - October). However, the pattern is less predictable than cases, suggesting that various factors beyond infection rate influence fatality outcomes, such as healthcare access or comorbidities. The highest death toll within a month (7) was seen twice in September and October 2010.
