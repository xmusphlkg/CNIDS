Rubella, also known as German measles, is a viral infection caused by the rubella virus. It primarily affects pregnant women and their developing fetuses, as the infection during pregnancy can result in severe birth defects and long-term disabilities known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Understanding the epidemiology of rubella is crucial for implementing effective prevention and control measures.

Historical Context and Discovery:
Rubella was first identified as a separate disease from measles and scarlet fever in the 18th century. However, its viral cause was not confirmed until the early 20th century. In 1938, Max Theiler successfully isolated the rubella virus, leading to further research on diagnosing and preventing the disease. Live attenuated vaccines for rubella were introduced in the 1960s.

Global Prevalence:
Rubella is a prevalent disease worldwide, although its incidence varies across regions. Prior to the introduction of the rubella vaccine, epidemics occurred approximately every 6-9 years. However, since the widespread vaccination, the incidence of rubella has significantly decreased, and some countries have interrupted the endemic transmission of rubella, nearing its eradication in those areas.

Transmission Routes:
Rubella is transmitted through respiratory droplets via person-to-person contact. It is highly contagious and can spread rapidly among susceptible populations. The virus can be transmitted by both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The incubation period of rubella is approximately 14 days, during which an infected person can transmit the virus to others, even before showing symptoms.

Affected Populations:
Although rubella can affect people of all ages, it is most commonly observed in children and young adults. The disease is generally milder in children, presenting with a rash, low-grade fever, and mild respiratory symptoms. However, rubella infection during pregnancy poses the greatest risk. If contracted by a pregnant woman, especially in the first trimester, rubella significantly increases the chances of complications and congenital rubella syndrome in the developing fetus.

Key Statistics:
- Prior to widespread vaccination, rubella epidemics caused an estimated 100,000 cases of CRS worldwide every year.
- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 78,000 infants were born with CRS globally in 2019.
- Rubella infection during pregnancy results in CRS in approximately 85% of cases when the virus is contracted in the first trimester.

Risk Factors Associated with Rubella Transmission:
1. Lack of Vaccination: The primary risk factor for rubella transmission is inadequate vaccine coverage. Unvaccinated individuals or communities with low vaccination rates remain susceptible to contracting and transmitting the virus.
2. Travel: International travel can contribute to the spread of rubella. People who travel to areas with ongoing rubella outbreaks may contract the virus and introduce it to their home communities.
3. Crowded Settings: Close contact with infected individuals in crowded settings such as schools, daycare centers, and healthcare facilities increases the risk of rubella transmission.
4. Pregnant Women: Pregnant women who are not vaccinated are particularly vulnerable to rubella infection. Transmission to the developing fetus can lead to severe birth defects and long-term disabilities.

Impact on Different Regions and Populations:
The impact of rubella varies across regions and populations due to differences in vaccination coverage, healthcare infrastructure, and population demographics. In regions with high vaccination coverage and effective immunization programs, rubella has been successfully controlled or eliminated.

However, in low-income countries with limited access to vaccines, rubella incidence remains higher. These areas often experience outbreaks and continue to bear the burden of CRS cases. Pregnant women are the most at-risk population in these regions, causing significant morbidity and mortality in newborns.

Additionally, vulnerable populations such as migrant communities and marginalized groups face an increased risk of rubella due to limited access to healthcare and immunization services. Therefore, efforts to improve vaccine equity and reach underserved populations are crucial in controlling the spread of rubella and preventing CRS.

In conclusion, understanding the epidemiology of rubella highlights the importance of vaccination in preventing its transmission and reducing the burden of congenital rubella syndrome. While progress has been made in controlling rubella in many regions, ongoing efforts are necessary to ensure high vaccination coverage, particularly among pregnant women and vulnerable populations.
## Introduction

Rubella, also known as German measles, is a contagious disease caused by the Rubella virus. It is typically mild in children but can have serious consequences in expecting mothers, potentially causing congenital rubella syndrome leading to significant fetal defects. The disease is characterized by symptoms like fever, sore throat, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. It spreads through the air or close contact and is preventable by widespread vaccination. Globally, immunization campaigns have dramatically reduced the incidence of rubella.

## Highlights

1. Overall decreasing trend of Rubella cases in China from 2010 to 2023, marking successful disease control efforts. 
2. No significant rise in cases in September over years, including September 2023, indicating stable seasonality.
3. Remarkably low number of fatalities, suggesting effective management and treatment strategies.
4. A noticeable peak occurs in spring (April-May) over the years suggesting season could influence the disease occurrence.
5. Dramatic drop in cases noted from 2020, likely due to pandemic-related restrictions and improved hygiene practices.

## Analysis

### Cases Analysis
The reported cases of Rubella in mainland China show cyclical patterns, with prominent peaks typically observed between March and June every year from 2010 to 2019. A marked decrease in cases is seen subsequently from 2020 onwards, with fewer peaks of lower intensity. The all-time high recorded in May 2011 (~18,445 cases) has not been surpassed since. The gradual reduction since 2011 followed by a notable decline post-2019 may suggest effective intervention strategies (like vaccination campaigns) or lesser reporting due to other significant health events.

### Deaths Analysis
The number of deaths due to Rubella is considerably low, with only seven reported deaths over the entire 13-year period. An interesting aspect is the sporadic nature of these deaths, with no clear trend across the years. This low mortality rate is in line with rubella's typical disease progression, as it is usually a mild condition but can have severe implications for pregnant women. Possible implications for public health response include both sustained vaccination efforts and focused education on the prevention of congenital rubella syndrome.
